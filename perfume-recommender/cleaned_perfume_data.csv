celestial eau de parfum,Electimuss," Heavenly, divine and of the gods. Gazing to the stars, the Romans were keen astronomers naming the planets after gods, and such was their belief in the power and influence of the skies over their destiny that they were also keen devotees of astrology.   The olibanum at the heart of this scent is a light, lemony incense with a conifer undertone, lifted by a spicy rose and underpinned by a warm woody base. Luminous, like the heavenly bodies which inspired it."," Saffron, raspberry, black pepper, olibanum, Indian rose absolut, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cedar, Paraguan guaiac wood, tonka",heavenly divine god gaze star romans keen astronomer name planet god belief power influence sky destiny also keen devotee astrology olibanum heart scent light lemony incense conifer undertone lift spicy rise underpin warm woody base luminous like heavenly body inspire

thurible eau de parfum,Rook Perfumes," The best kept secret about incense in perfumery is how magically versatile it is- it can be smoky, of course, but also resinous and animalic, or sparkling and fresh, or opulent and narcotic. Thurible is the rare incense scent that seems to contain it all, a wonderfully complex ode to this beloved material that still coalesces into a beautifully wearable and stylish signature.

suede eau de parfum,Rook Perfumes," Polarizing and provocative, Rook's take on leather is perhaps not as smooth as the name Suede might suggest, but for those who love animalic, realistically raw leather, there's nothing else like it. Smoky, rugged, untanned leather is the star, still recognizably charred and fleshy, harkening back to times where leather was still made by hand. It weaves in a rich tobacco leaf, earthy, sweet, and natural, like the leathermaker was sitting at his tanning bench with a rolled cigarette dangling from his lips. While a delicate undercurrent of smooth suede makes the name more than just playful irony, those who only love the most delicate leather scents may want to look elsewhere. But for those who love raw, animalic, smoky leather, this is a magic potion not to be missed."," suede, tobacco leaf, leather",polarize provocative rook take leather perhaps not smooth name suede may suggest love animalic realistically raw leather nothing else like smoky rugged untanned leather star still recognizably char fleshy harken back time leather still make hand weave rich tobacco leaf earthy sweet natural like leathermaker sit tan bench roll cigarette dangle lip delicate undercurrent smooth suede make name playful irony love delicate leather scent may want look elsewhere love raw animalic smoky leather magic potion not miss
amber eau de parfum,Rook Perfumes," When we say we love amber scents, we don't just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive ""amber"" note in perfume. Which is good, because neither ingredient is anywhere to be found in Rook's new Amber scent. What we really love, however, is the spirit of amber- powerful, sensual, spiritual, and comforting, all at once- and that, this Amber has in multitudes. It opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark.

interlude black iris eau de parfum,Amouage," Inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an Iris flower by Georgia O'Keeffe, Interlude Black Iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. Just as with the original Interlude Man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original Interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, Black Iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. The intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. Richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. If Interlude Man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, Interlude Black Iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?"," Bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",inspire 1926 closeup painting iris flower georgia okeeffe interlude black iris deeply seductive wickedly clever reimagine regal men classic original interlude man initially impose burst almost majestically powerful frankincense reveal wondrously harmonious interior life develop whereas original interlude carry effusive spiceladen warmth baking desert sun black iris dispatch inky midnight sky star illuminate mouthwatere smorgasbord rare delight intense aromatic oregano rosemary original toned leave opening relatively cool sparkle wet turn unlock narcotic smoothness buttery orris violet leaf richly smoky agarwood frankincense still carry royal splendor base leans towards sandalwood cedar creamy robust interlude man blind crown polished jewel interlude black iris flow impossibly soft velvet robe king not need
escale en haiti eau de cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables transports us to the bustling and beautiful Les Cayes region of Haiti, and their signature crop- vetiver, considered by many to be the best in all the world. Les Cayes vetiver is renowned for its richness and depth- allowed to mature beneath the soil for up to 2 years before harvesting, it develops uniquely bright, sweet citrus tones in addition to the expected earthy and woody properties. And for Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables uses a 22% concentration of the absolute finest vetiver Les Cayes has to offer: a ""Grand Cru"" distillation hand-selected from unique terroir, carefully root-harvested, and painstakingly distilled at atmospheric pressure, a slower and more expensive process that provides a richer, longer-lasting extract. The results are a stunning natural vetiver cologne with real depth, each ingredient carefully chosen to highlight an element of the extraordinary main ingredient. Electric pink pepper from Reunion Island and aromatic juniper oil from Macedonia bring a spicy, fresh burst, while rich Venezuelan tonka and Somalian myrrh essential oil add a touch of creamy, powdered elegance to the subtle but long-lasting base. Vetiver lovers looking for both freshness and disctinction- this is one you won't want to miss."," Pink pepper, juniper, Haitian vetiver, tonka bean, myrhh",perhaps classic scent leau de cologne style stay perpetually fashion wonderful simplicity feature light concentration put emphasis freshness wearability edc actually ideal format showcase exquisite natural material high concentration may feel overwhelming part rich busy perfume escale en haiti les indemodable transport us bustling beautiful les cayes region haiti signature crop vetiver consider many good world les cayes vetiver renowned richness depth allow mature beneath soil 2 year harvesting develop uniquely bright sweet citrus tone addition expect earthy woody property escale en haiti les indemodable use 22 concentration absolute fine vetiver les cayes offer grand cru distillation handselecte unique terroir carefully rootharveste painstakingly distil atmospheric pressure slow expensive process provide rich longerlaste extract result stunning natural vetiver cologne real depth ingredient carefully choose highlight element extraordinary main ingredient electric pink pepper reunion island aromatic juniper oil macedonia bring spicy fresh burst rich venezuelan tonka somalian myrrh essential oil add touch creamy powder elegance subtle longlaste base vetiver lover look freshness disctinction one not want miss
escale en indonesie eau de cologne,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Indonesie, Les Indemodables has chosen to showcase a spectacular specimen of one of the most precious materials in all of perfumery- ambergris. Recovered from the paradise of Sumatra, Indonesia, this top-graded white ambergris was painstakingly distilled into a ""Grand Cru"" tincture, broken down with state-of-the-art ultrasound and then carefully tinctured for over six months to achieve a sublime level of complexity. Every possible facet of this fabled material- vivid ozonic tones, sensual animalics, and electric saltiness- are fully presented, delivering a depth and longevity that are rare for an eau de cologne. And a suite of carefully chosen complementary notes add more EDC freshness- a sunny sparkle of Calabrian bergamot and Sicilian lemon combine with a green, floral freshness from Moroccan neroli oil. Each note teases out even more complexity from the ambergris, which feels as bright and refreshing as the citrus opening but soon gains creamy, seductive tonality from a smooth jasmine and sandalwood base. Don't worry if this sounds a bit heavy for an EDC, as it's delivered with a wonderfully light touch that makes it oh so wearable. But if you've ever wanted a scent that harnessed the true power of ambergris while also maintaining delightful everyday wearability, don't let this hidden gem pass you by."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, Indonesian ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood",perhaps classic scent leau de cologne style stay perpetually fashion wonderful simplicity feature light concentration put emphasis freshness wearability edc actually ideal format showcase exquisite natural material high concentration may feel overwhelming part rich busy perfume escale en indonesie les indemodable choose showcase spectacular speciman one precious material perfumery ambergris recover paradise sumatra indonesia topgrade white ambergris painstakingly distil grand cru tincture break stateoftheart ultrasound carefully tincture six month achieve sublime level complexity every possible facet fable material vivid ozonic tone sensual animalics electric saltiness fully present deliver depth longevity rare eau de cologne suite carefully choose complementary note add edc freshness sunny sparkle calabrian bergamot sicilian lemon combine green floral freshness moroccan neroli oil note tease even complexity ambergris feel bright refreshing citrus opening soon gain creamy seductive tonality smooth jasmine sandalwood base not worry sound bit heavy edc deliver wonderfully light touch make oh wearable ever want scent harness true power ambergris also maintain delightful everyday wearability not let hide gem pass

1979 new wave eau de parfum,Les Bains Guerbois," As the seventies turned to the eighties, the nightlife at Bains Douches turned from the glitzy excess of disco to a new sound that was both melodic and modern, but also rawer and more emotionally intense than what had come before.

ambre stone eau de parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In Ambre Stone, a juicy burst of bergamot takes an autumnal and sensual turn with the earthy addition of patchouli, rich sandalwood with a hint of indolic jasmine. But it's real ambergris that takes this scent to a whole new level, sprinkling the composition with that ingredient's inimitable fairy dust, adding warmth, coziness, and sensuality like the golden light of an autumn sun on a picturesque summer scene.Due to its rarity and cost, ambergris (grey amber), the aged and oxidized exudate from a whaleat once sweet, earthy, marine and animalicis largely found in synthetic form in perfume. But this almost mythic ingredient is in a 5% dose in Ambre Stone, adding a dreamy sensuousness to the edges of the fragrance's brightness. As with all ingredients sourced by L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res, the lump of ambergris is first selected from a trusted partner. Then, Jean Philippe Paris, AFDM's scientific director, processes the ambergris for around six months into a tincture or infusion, until it is deemed, along with the evaluation of perfumer Antoine Lie, to be ready to use. Ambre Stone, by the time it dries down, is a skin scent of voluptuous beauty that will have you inhaling yourself with abandon."," Ambergris infusion, Indonesian Patchouli oil, Egyptian Jasmine absolute late crop, Moroccan Neroli oil, Indian Sandalwood oil, Italian Bergamot oil late crop",ambre stone juicy burst bergamot take autumnal sensual turn earthy addition patchouli rich sandalwood hint indolic jasmine real ambergris take scent whole new level sprinkling composition ingredient inimitable fairy dust add warmth coziness sensuality like golden light autumn sun picturesque summer scene due rarity cost ambergris grey amber aged oxidize exudate whaleat sweet earthy marine animalicis largely find synthetic form perfume almost mythic ingredient 5 dose ambre stone add dreamy sensuousness edges fragrance brightness ingredient source latelier franaais des matia res lump ambergris first select trust partner jean philippe paris afdms scientific director process ambergris around six month tincture infusion deem along evaluation perfumer antoine lie ready use ambre stone time dry skin scent voluptuous beauty inhale abandon

jasmin de cherifa eau de parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus," Just over an hour's drive north of Cairo, there's a botanical garden where L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res Egyptian partner Cherifa Fakhry and his family cultivate an array of aromatic plants, including the stellar jasmine used in the perfume that pays him homage  Jasmin de ChÃ©rifa.Due to jasmine's high cost, most perfumes use synthetic versions, which tend to smell sharp and linear. Jasmin de Cherifa's real jasmine will take you on a journey of the flower's scent life cycle and in the process, taking your breathe away...Cherifa was asked to use the flowers from their fields' early, middle, and late crops to provide the full olfactive spectrum of the jasmine they harvest from June to October.

i love yy,Bogue Profumo," I LOVE YY is Antonio Gardoni's dual declaration of love- first, to New York City, a place he fell over heels for from his very first visit. But that title isn't a typo- YY, another object of his affection, is short for Ylang Ylang, that uniquely big, open, complex floral known for all the ways it smells unlike any other flower- sometimes grassy, sometimes gourmand, sometimes woodsy and resinous. When we asked Antonio to make us an exclusive fragrance to celebrate the opening of our first NYC boutique, he connected NY and YY, and the rest was a match made in heaven- or, at least, in the heart of Nolita.And leave it to Antonio to construct a fragrance that truly captures the energy and beauty of NYC. I LOVE YY is a whirlwind of delightful chaos, with perfect touches of New York everywhere you look- cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. The titular ylang note is camphorous and lactonic, joining tonka, rose, and jasmine to feel sweet and rich, buzzing like a packed after-hours party. Cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. An edgy violet leaf recalls the flashbulbs and fluorescents of a hot new gallery opening in the Meatpacking District. And all of these notes intertwine in a glorious hum of energy, light, sweetness and intoxicating depth that can only represent one single, gigantic, overwhelming, wonderful city. We couldn't be more excited that Antonio Gardoni and Bogue chose to join us in our inaugural NYC adventure.

new york eau de parfum,Widian," New York City in the spring may be the most magical place in the world. For once a year, the electric bustle of the city is balanced with delightfully mild temperatures, gentle sunshine, and a fresh breeze that draws even the most cynical citydwellers out into New York's beautiful and far-flung public spaces, now teeming with the energy of new life. This is the inspiration for New York, the latest in Widian's tribute to the great cities, an explosion of bright citrus, spicy florals, and musky woods that positively vibrates with the extraordinary dynamism of the Big Apple. All the energy of a New York spring is present from the very first spray, as New York bursts forth with sun-soaked notes of lemon, bergamot, and mandarin, kissed with a burst of pink pepper. The spicy, aromatic bouquet only grows richer in the romantic heart notes, as striking floral notes of lavender, geranium and rose are combined with coriander and juniper, conjuring a lusciously fresh and deeply sensual tone. And as the smooth, ambered base of tobacco, musk, and never-too-heavy vanilla emerges, you can practically feel the sun setting, and a nighttime of endless possibilities on the horizon.

gold ii sahara parfum extrait,Widian," Like its companion fragrance Gold I, the luminous, captivating Gold II (now presented as Gold II Sahara) is built around the fragrance accord most associated with the precious metal- amber. But while Gold I's amber was powerful and opulent, Sahara is luxuriously smooth, a floral musk with a deep, soft muskiness that evaporates the concerns and trivialities of everyday life in a wondrous cloud of creamy, gently powdery sensuality.On the very first spray of Sahara, a remarkably uplifting opening of bright citrus, rich saffron and spicy elemi invigorates, before the softness of the rose and orange blossom heart steadies the tempo and soothes the soul.

bengale rouge eau de parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Inspired by the stunning, tiger-like dappling of shade and light on the fur of her Bengal cat Mimi, Liz Moore's latest creation is a soft, cozily-spiced oriental that's as sensuous as a cat in full stretch. Miles away from the overt sexuality of Salome, Bengale Rouge's only hint of the animalic is the honeyed, fuzzy glow of the resins, which give the perfume a sensual warmth that's more kitten than tiger. Bengale Rouge dips a soft, attar-like rose and sandalwood into a doughy, rooty iris and wraps it all up in a halo of headily-spiced resins. It's simply gorgeous. With its benzoin-rich vanilla swirled with caramelized labdanum, clove-scented opoponax, and the citrusy brightness of a Turkish rose, Bengale Rouge at first appears to take up the glittering mantle of the great orientals of the past, such as Shalimar and Opium. However, we are steered away from the powdered classicism of these perfumes by the clever addition by the perfumer of a dollop of edible vanilla that lends the scent a modern gourmand vibe that will have you wanting to lick your own skin. The vanilla gourmand aspect doesn't dominate; but neither does the dry and spicy resin facet  they dance and intertwine like perfect halves of one whole for a golden, opulent effect that perfectly mimics the interplay of light and dark on Mimi's fur coat. It's a total love from us.

midnight saffron eau de parfum,Tom Daxon," Lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. Midnight Saffron, born of Tom Daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. As the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of France and Bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. As Midnight Saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. As we mentioned at the top, Midnight Saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are."," Saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",lavender moment fragrance house everywhere toss aside reputation sleepinduce hippie oil rediscover electric sensuality midnight saffron bear tom daxon long stand love lavender take energy run wild mix potent cocktail spicy wood create vibrantly sexy scent carry wee hour name would suggest central spice involve saffron strip foody element reveal raw crackle carnality underneath turn amps animalic energy exquisite lavender note create mixture france bulgarias fine lavender oil absolute midnight saffron dry smoothly woodsy leather note enhance refine energy never dip even drydown mention top midnight saffron different take lavender one ready stay late

opale eau de parfum,Omnia Profumo," Truly a breath of fresh air, Opale is a gem of a marine floral that evokes the sun-drenched gardens and sparkling waters of the Mediterranean coast. From the very first spritz, a symphony of gentle florals flits through the air, combining the soft purity of jasmine and lilac with delicately spicy and earthy notes of hawthorne and geranium. But the core of the scent is an oh-so-oceanside note of fresh, salty, ozonic seaweed that wraps around a smooth and lively white musk to create a pitch-perfect image of a relaxing coastal breeze, which lingers for hours thanks to touches of woodsy and gourmand notes to accentuate and enrich the authentically oceanic tang.

poudrextase eau de parfum,Marlou," With a name that combines the French words for ""powder"" and ""ecstasy, "" it's not difficult to imagine what Marlou has in mind with their newest fragrance. But concept alone can't do justice to Pourdrextase; after all,  this is Marlou we're talking about here,  a line that does one thing- intensely erotic,  deeply animalic musk- and does it just about better than anyone. And even if their smolderingly over-the-top previous releases have been a bit too intense for you,  we'd strongly encourage you to try again,  as Poudrextase explores a duality of skin scents- on one hand,  the primal musk,  on the other,  the fresh powder and minimal florals of expensive cosmetics on clean skin- and the result is Marlou's most wonderfully accessible scent yet. Here,  the rice powder is bright and fresh,  almost citrussy,  and the dried rose just delicately sweet enough to smooth out the funk of the animalics,  which retain every ounce of the full-bodied carnality of Marlou's previous gems. It's very much a portrait of skin in full- the proper and the profane,  the clean and the dirty.

donna sentenza eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," Donna Sentenza was born of a joke Hilde Soliani shared with famed Italian butcher, Simone Fracassi, about her possibly slipping on a banana peel. Hilde Soliani slip on a banana peel? Never! Donna Sentenza, the perfume, has the same zany sense of humor and zest for life as Hilde Soliani herself.

Banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York. Banana cream pie. When life is getting you down, why not take a break from it all and put a smile back on your face with this deliciously milky banana concoction? Donna Sentenza smells exactly like banana pudding, with layers of banana sandwiched with whipped cream, sugar, and a hint of smoky Nilla wafers around the edges.

manteuse eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A play on words combining the deadly praying mantis with the french word for ""deceiver, "" Manteuse is quite clearly not meant to be a gentle fragrance. Instead,  this bold new floral from Stephane Humbert Lucas is a swaggering,  sensuous throwback to the unapologetic musky florals of the 1990s,  strong,  warm,  and utterly mesmerizing. Opening with a rich,  vivid blast of bergamot and bright white florals,  Manteuse stuns its prey before injecting its poison,  a deeply narcotic,  languorous blend of sweet honey and rich,  resin-flushed iris. As the deeply powdery,  smoothly seductive base of woodsy musks takes hold,  we find ourselves utterly paralyzed,  gripped with uncontrollable pleasure,  defenseless against the gorgeous power of the scent.

against nature eau de parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. Like the journey of Huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. Intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul. Vivid and intriguing, this is most certainly not a scent for everyone- something Huysmans would most certainly approve of."," Pink pepper, lemon, juniper, green notes, metal, jasmine, ylang ylang, lacquer, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, patchouli",inspire joriskarl huysmans 1884 novel name broke naturalist root decadent reinterpretation nature ornate along undercurrent unmistakably human component like journey huysmans protagonist isolate earth order rebuild outside conventional society scent primal intellectual compelling disturb untethered utterly unapologetic intense note lush leafy green foliage moist soil earthy mosses merge note cold metal blood lacquer invoke wildly unique atmosphere somewhere primordial world flawed brilliant human soul vivid intriguing certainly not scent everyone something huysmans would certainly approve
cornaline eau de parfum,Anatole Lebreton," When Anatole Lebreton conceptualizes a new fragrance, we sit up and take notice. After all, his brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging or signature notes- a Lebreton scent is a uniquely formed work of art, with rustic, romantic and fantastical elements all hypnotically intertwined to create scents that stand alone as works of individual creativity. Cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, Lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. Cornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color. First, geranium shines forth with spicy assertiveness, followed by an energetic vibration of orris, and a fruit-inflected, beautifully sweet ylang ylang. Now, the fruits and florals explode forth, painting a vivid mural of springtime delights with distinct touches of hyacinth and ""belle du jour"" mirabilis, a perfect blend of spicy and fruity. And finally, an increasingly sensual bed of musk and vanilla glows with the poised relaxation of twilight. Joyful yet masterfully restrained, opulent yet luminous, Cornaline is another opus from one of niche perfume's brightest lights."," Carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla",anatole lebreton conceptualize new fragrance sit take notice brand aesthetic go far beyond packaging signature note lebreton scent uniquely form work art rustic romantic fantastical element hypnotically intertwine create scent stand alone work individual creativity cornaline ode brightness light color no exception combine unexpected natural element spice fruit floral lebreton deliver dazzlingly bright scent slowly deliberately transition twinkle twilight cornaline open distinctive unforgettable note carrot root almost synthetic feel uniqueness perfect leadin cascade fruit flower radiate distinctive unforgettable color first geranium shine forth spicy assertiveness follow energetic vibration orris fruitinflecte beautifully sweet ylang ylang fruit floral explode forth painting vivid mural springtime delight distinct touch hyacinth belle du jour mirabilis perfect blend spicy fruity finally increasingly sensual bed musk vanilla glow poise relaxation twilight joyful yet masterfully restrain opulent yet luminous cornaline another opus one niche perfumes bright light
bluebijou eau de parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," For far too long, ""blue"" has been used to describe the most generic of fragrances- blandly masculine, synthetically aquatic, outright boring.

Enter Bluebijou, a unique, vibrant, unrestrained reinterpretation of the blue scent. Instead of scratchy, synthetic freshness, Bluebijou delivers juicy, sumptuous blueberry, bright violet, rich cocoa, and unmistakable truffle, all atop an impossibly deep base of dark oud and deeply boozy cognac.

kiviskin eau de parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," Inspired by the beauty of luxury leather goods, Kiviskin is a bracingly fresh, invigoratingly natural-feeling scent, painting a bold portrait of spice, tobacco and suede.

niral eau de parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Neela Vermeire has always been a line of unmatched elegance, where the rich cultural heritage of India and the refinement of western perfumery go hand in hand to create enchanting, delightful fragrances. Niral, from a Hindi word and name connoting uniqueness and serenity, is inspired by Sir Thomas Wardle, a 19th-century expert in the sericulture and the Indian wild silk trade, and so it's only appropriate that the fragrance is a stunningly smooth blend of florals, spices and musks that's as silky as they come. Opening with a refined iris, smoothed with tea and liqueur notes to balance earthy, papery and floral in perfect equilibrium, Niral gently reveals a luxuriously rich, yet subtle heart of rose, spice and musks, atop an equally serene base of precious woods and supple leather. Like Sir Thomas's silk, which was used by the eras most prestigious designers and textile artists, it's sheer textural delight, softness and sophistication all in one, and a melding of the most elegant techniques that both India and Europe have to offer- you won't want to miss it."," Iris, pink pepper, tea, Turkish rose, green wine lees, cabreuva, angelica seed, ambrette seed, cardamom, leather, magnolia, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar",neela vermeire always line unmatched elegance rich cultural heritage india refinement western perfumery go hand hand create enchanting delightful fragrance niral hindi word name connote uniqueness serenity inspire sir thomas wardle 19thcentury expert sericulture indian wild silk trade appropriate fragrance stunningly smooth blend floral spice musks silky come opening refined iris smooth tea liqueur note balance earthy papery floral perfect equilibrium niral gently reveal luxuriously rich yet subtle heart rise spice musks atop equally serene base precious wood supple leather like sir thomass silk use eras prestigious designer textile artist sheer textural delight softness sophistication one melding elegant technique india europe offer not want miss
london eau de parfum,Widian," The Sapphire Collection, a new collection by Widian, formerly AJ Arabia, is the perfect fusion of East meets West. The East: Widian, an Arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of Sheikh Zayed's Grand Mosque and the modern Arab spirit in the city of Abu Dhabi. The West: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest Western cities, such as London, Paris, and New York. Traditional Arabic perfumery meets Western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, East and West. London is Widian's first entry in the Sapphire Collection, and it nails the East-meets-West theme with aplomb. On the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. But the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the Far East sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from London and towards the East. Its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the Arabian Peninsula.  Simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to London, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when Eastern exoticism meets Western polish. London truly is a winning proposition."," Oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",sapphire collection new collection widian formerly aj arabia perfect fusion east meet west east widian arabian niche perfume firm inspire architecture sheikh zayed grand mosque modern arab spirit city abu dhabi west glitter cityscapes grand western city london paris new york traditional arabic perfumery meet western abstraction perfect fusion old new traditional contemporary yes east west london widian first entry sapphire collection nail eastmeetsw theme aplomb surface juicy raspberry delicate floral petal flank lush cypress leather accord smoky moody darkness agarwood jungles far east sweep shadow underneath freshness scene tugging us away london towards east exotic mystery deepen amber musk lend scent radiantly dry sandy texture turn gaze redgold dessert arabian peninsula simultaneously reassure exciting fragrance fitting tribute london perfect vehicle show happen eastern exoticism meet western polish london truly win proposition
buonissimo eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," Ask anyone what their fondest scent memory is, and chances are, the scent of baking bread will be invoked. For Luckyscent's 15th anniversary, our most inventive gourmand nose, Hilde Soliani, created her loveliest, most nostalgia-inducing scent, exclusively for us - Buonissimo. Imagine waking up in a charming Italian town over a simple breakfast of a hot cup of foamed cappuccino and a freshly baked sweet pastry. The fantastical Hilde brings this vision to life in the form of what the Italians call brioche- the fair lovechild between a flaky French croissant and clasically airy French brioche. It's perfectly buttery, and fluffy with a sugared vanilla. But it wouldn't be a Hilde Soliani without that how-did-she-do-that element, and here, she's captured the sweet egg wash over the pastries' gentle slopes, caramelized a crispy golden brown from the oven.  And don't forget - from beginning to end, like every proper Italian day, the dark swirl of espresso and cream is ever-present, lending its mature sophistication. This is a serious must have for any gourmand connoisseur.","vanilla, cream, cappuccino",ask anyone fond scent memory chance scent baking bread invoke luckyscent 15th anniversary inventive gourmand nose hilde soliani create lovely nostalgiainduce scent exclusively us buonissimo imagine wake charming italian town simple breakfast hot cup foam cappuccino freshly baked sweet pastry fantastical hilde bring vision life form italians call brioche fair lovechild flaky french croissant clasically airy french brioche perfectly buttery fluffy sugar vanilla would not hilde soliani without howdidshedothat element capture sweet egg wash pastry gentle slope caramelize crispy golden brown oven not forget begin end like every proper italian day dark swirl espresso cream everpresent lending mature sophistication serious must gourmand connoisseur
boronia eau de parfum,Grandiflora," Boronia is a very unusual fruity-floral composition based around a small, shrubby flower native to Western Australia, the eponymous boronia. Some varieties of the shrub can smell warm and woodsy, but this particular variety smells fruity and spicy, like a handful of ripe apricots dusted in cinnamon and lemon peel. There is even a minty freshness to the topnotes reminiscent of cassis leaf. The boronia also lends the perfume an ionone-rich feel, the silvery powder of violets and iris joining with a distinctive plum jam note to create an almost winey floral bouquet. The hay-like tones of a golden immortelle provide a textured backdrop to the florals, giving the scent a pleasantly rustic, early fall harvest feel: dried grass, hay, tobacco leaves turning to brown paper in the sun, and the dusty red earth of the Australian outback. Black tea and apricots create a suede impression, but it's a credit to the perfumer that the foodier notes of caramel, fruit, and cognac are never allowed to turn Boronia into a gourmand. It is fruity and rich, yes, but balanced by the tannic sharpness of tea and hay, the scent manages to stay elegantly dry. If you love the autumnal, plummy darkness of chypres such as Voleur de Roses and Mon Parfum Cheri Par Camille, then you will love Boronia too."," Boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel",boronia unusual fruityfloral composition base around small shrubby flower native western australia eponymous boronia variety shrub smell warm woodsy particular variety smell fruity spicy like handful ripe apricot dust cinnamon lemon peel even minty freshness topnote reminiscent cassis leaf boronia also lend perfume iononerich feel silvery powder violet iris join distinctive plum jam note create almost winey floral bouquet haylike tone golden immortelle provide texture backdrop floral give scent pleasantly rustic early fall harvest feel dry grass hay tobacco leave turn brown paper sun dusty red earth australian outback black tea apricot create suede impression credit perfumer foodier note caramel fruit cognac never allow turn boronia gourmand fruity rich yes balance tannic sharpness tea hay scent manage stay elegantly dry love autumnal plummy darkness chypre voleur de rose mon parfum cheri par camille love boronia
ambilux (formerly 50ml d'ambiguite) eau de parfum,Marlou," Ambilux is ambiguous only in the sense that it is puzzling that a list of largely plant-based spices, resins, and florals adds up to something so unapologetically animal. The first blast has our eyes rolling back in pleasure: a thickly furred musk redolent of warm animal, dripping tallow candles, and the salty skin of a loved one. That there are new perfumes out there that dare to challenge the great Muscs Khoublai Khan and Musc Tonkin is a pleasant surprise. Although Ambilux is quite different to these perfumes, it possesses the same earthy, no-holds-barred sensuality and a texture that is distinctly retro in its velvety thickness. The creator intended for this perfume to reflect the unique olfactory fingerprint we all carry, our own personal aroma, imprinting onto others as we touch, kiss, and make contact. But like its distant progenitor, L'Air de Rien, it also captures the smells of our nest: dusty spaces, books, pots overflowing with flowers, and old wood.  Despite the listed notes, what we predominantly pick up is a warm, oily sheep's wool nuance  waxy and lanolin-like, deeply inviting to the touch. Costus root is what gives the perfume its arousing animal fattiness, but it is used subtly here, woven into the other notes for an effect that is intimate but not uncomfortably close. The sweet, slippery feel of the woolen musk is cut with a bright, almost briny ylang note, aerating the heart with a salty breeze. In the drydown, castoreum gives us nuances of dry, smoky tobacco and leather. Ambilux captures all the grimy intimacy of our own bodies, our loved ones, and the crawl spaces of our inner sanctum: it's sexy, but also comfortable and elegant.     Update: Ambilux is a new version of the beloved 50ml d'Ambiguite, made a bit lighter, warmer, and more wearable while retaining all the animalic sensuality of the original.)"," Pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus",ambilux ambiguous sense puzzle list largely plantbase spice resin floral add something unapologetically animal first blast eye roll back pleasure thickly fur musk redolent warm animal drip tallow candle salty skin love one new perfumes dare challenge great muscs khoublai khan musc tonkin pleasant surprise although ambilux quite different perfumes possesse earthy noholdsbarre sensuality texture distinctly retro velvety thickness creator intend perfume reflect unique olfactory fingerprint carry personal aroma imprint onto touch kiss make contact like distant progenitor lair de rien also capture smell nest dusty space book pot overflow flower old wood despite list note predominantly pick warm oily sheeps wool nuance waxy lanolinlike deeply invite touch costus root give perfume arouse animal fattiness use subtly weave note effect intimate not uncomfortably close sweet slippery feel woolen musk cut bright almost briny ylang note aerate heart salty breeze drydown castoreum give us nuance dry smoky tobacco leather ambilux capture grimy intimacy body love one crawl space inner sanctum sexy also comfortable elegant update ambilux new version beloved 50ml dambiguite make bit light warm wearable retain animalic sensuality original
grimoire eau de parfum,Anatole Lebreton," A Grimoire: an ancient word for an ancient tome of spells, a sacred text, powerful in the right hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Anatole Lebreton invites us to imagine such a volume, weathered by age and coated in dust, at the center of an overgrown cabin, invisible to all but the trained eye. An open window lets just the faintest sliver of light inside, along with the scents of green moss climbing the walls and a well-cultivated garden of herbs and spices, essential for the creation of magical objects. Dense clouds of incense dance in the light-beam, hinting at secrets unknowable, power as-of-yet untapped, waiting in a realm directly above and below our own. Warm, rich woods from the cabin walls and dusty paper from the pages of the book give rich body to the unique aroma inside, comforting but imposing, like a warm embrace you might never emerge from. An incense fragrance well beyond the confines of the modern world."," Bergamot, basil, lavender, elemi, olibanum, Atlas cedar, cumin, patchouli, moss, muscs",grimoire ancient word ancient tome spell sacred text powerful right hand dangerous wrong one anatole lebreton invites us imagine volume weather age coat dust center overgrow cabin invisible train eye open window lets faint sliver light inside along scent green moss climb wall wellcultivate garden herbs spice essential creation magical object dense cloud incense dance lightbeam hinting secret unknowable power asofyet untapped wait realm directly warm rich wood cabin wall dusty paper page book give rich body unique aroma inside comfort impose like warm embrace may never emerge incense fragrance well beyond confine modern world
the decay of the angel eau de parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," This is a memorizing, burnt bouquet of exotic flowers inspired by Yukio Mishima's 1971 posthumously published novel, The Decay of The Angel. Like all of Timothy Han's creations, the highest level of natural ingredients are used here, and Han's artistic vision presents a smart,  deeply affecting fragrance that walks us through the 5 stages of a falling angel: decay, diaphoresis, dirt, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, darkness.Han's olfactive interpretation of an angelic fall starts with mandarin doused rose, ylang, and neroli. The fresh opening is contrasted with a heart of indolic jasmine, ripe and just starting to wilt. Its gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along with smoldering cade, oud and cedar woods.Â  Patchouli, tonka and labdanum add a dimension of soft earthiness.A sensual intermingling of hedione and musk float throughout the charred dry-down, contrasting heavenly veneration and human desires. Dazzling, challenging, and alluring, The Decay of The Angel makes a strong argument for the sensual perks of mortality."," Mandarin, neroli, rose, ylang-ylang, frankincense, sambac jasmine, acacia, cade, oud, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka, labdanum",memorize burn bouquet exotic flower inspire yukio mishimas 1971 posthumously publish novel decay angel like timothy hans creation high level natural ingredient use hans artistic vision present smart deeply affect fragrance walk us 5 stage fall angel decay diaphoresis dirt dissatisfaction ultimately darkness hans olfactive interpretation angelic fall start mandarin douse rise ylang neroli fresh opening contrast heart indolic jasmine ripe start wilt gloriously smoky base include crisp frankincense along smoldering cade oud cedar woodsa patchouli tonka labdanum add dimension soft earthiness sensual intermingle hedione musk float throughout char drydown contrast heavenly veneration human desire dazzle challenge alluring decay angel make strong argument sensual perk mortality
dryad eau de parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Liz Moores, perfumer behind Papillon Perfumes, lives in a house deep inside the New Forest, surrounded by a menagerie of children, horses, and animals that she has rescued and nurtured. Given that the forest forms a protective ring around Liz and her animals, it makes sense that Dryad feels like her most personal perfume yet, inspired as it is by the nymphs said to dwell in oak trees according to Greek mythology. Dryad is a sylvan fantasy of friendly trees linking their branches together to form a sunlit, green canopy over your head. Although far sexier and more ruggedly outdoorsy than anything from Guerlain or Dior, fans of vintage Vol de Nuit and Miss Dior will still feel a thrill of recognition at Dyrad's damp, mossy heart of galbanum, narcissus and an overdose of genuine oakmoss. Smoky, tough galbanum and clary sage add a resinous, rubbery dry warmth to the moistness of the green heart, and there is a touch of sun-burnt hay by way of deer tongue, a plant rich in coumarin and vanilla, and often used to flavor tobacco. Costus and apricot add a sly hint of naughty inner thigh  but just a hint. Dryad is a shamanic, witchy, but also relaxed scent that coaxes open the rigidly classical lines of the classic green chypre, ushering in sunlight, herbs, and a bunch of bright aromatics. The result is a Green Goddess of a fragrance, and the first green chypre that belongs more in the forest than in the boardroom."," cedrat, bigaradier orange, bergamot, narcissus, oakmoss, jonquil, clary sage, orange blossom, lavender, orris, vetiver, thyme, galbanum, costus, tarragon, apricot, benzoin, peru balsam, styrax",liz moore perfumer behind papillon perfumes life house deep inside new forest surround menagerie child horse animal rescue nurture give forest form protective around liz animal make sense dryad feel like personal perfume yet inspire nymphs say dwell oak tree accord greek mythology dryad sylvan fantasy friendly tree link branch together form sunlit green canopy head although far sexier ruggedly outdoorsy anything guerlain dior fan vintage vol de nuit miss dior still feel thrill recognition dyrad damp mossy heart galbanum narcissus overdose genuine oakmoss smoky tough galbanum clary sage add resinous rubbery dry warmth moistness green heart touch sunburnt hay way deer tongue plant rich coumarin vanilla often use flavor tobacco costus apricot add sly hint naughty inner thigh hint dryad shamanic witchy also relaxed scent coaxes open rigidly classical line classic green chypre usher sunlight herbs bunch bright aromatics result green goddess fragrance first green chypre belong forest boardroom
l'homme accompli eau de parfum,Divine," Yann Vasnier has done it again. A fresh, bone-dry masculine leather, L'Homme Accompli exudes quiet class from every pore. Opening on the classic snap of a Farina-style eau de cologne, the bristle of herbs and lemon soon dies back to reveal a musky, violet leaf-driven leather that will bring tears to the eyes of the vintage Fahrenheit lover. It is at once a familiar and elegant smell  signature scent worthy for the man who is sure of his place in the world. Bolstered by a musky Atlas cedar, L'Homme Accompli's leather accord has tremendous body and presence, while managing to skip all the sweet, gouty richness of modern masculine leathers. And it's that lightness of touch that makes this fragrance so special - the air and space that Vasnier has injected into its structure allows room to breathe. L'Homme Accompli grows ever drier and darker as time passes, the herbs and violet leather curling up under the smoke of styrax resin and guaiac wood, and finishing in a salty whisper of beach amber. If Cary Grant were a fragrance, he would be L'Homme Accompli."," Amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, atlas cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot",yann vasni fresh bonedry masculine leather lhomme accompli exude quiet class every pore opening classic snap farinastyle eau de cologne bristle herbs lemon soon die back reveal musky violet leafdriven leather bring tear eye vintage fahrenheit lover familiar elegant smell signature scent worthy man sure place world bolster musky atlas cedar lhomme accomplis leather accord tremendous body presence manage skip sweet gouty richness modern masculine leather lightness touch make fragrance special air space vasni inject structure allow room breathe lhomme accompli grow ever drier darker time pass herbs violet leather curl smoke styrax resin guaiac wood finish salty whisper beach amber cary grant fragrance would lhomme accompli

chamber eau de parfum,Fueguia 1833," Chamber's first perfume was created inspired by the thought of architecture, the analogy. Inspired by architect Louis Kahn's breathtaking, groundbreaking Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Chamber is a scent dedicated to exploring interior space, something it does with an impressively creative array of materials drawn from every level of the natural world, from the bottom of a vast lake to high above our heads. To represent the museum's abundance of concrete, marble, glass, grass and solar light, Chamber employs a fascinating blend of green, fresh, mineralic and spiced notes, notably fondo de lago, a collection of plant life harvested from the lake floor, which combines with tree moss and mate to deliver a sophisticated and unpredictable green scent with compelling depth and an emerging airiness evocative of the steady flow of light across the Kimbell's famed vaulted ceilings. Kahn's genius was to design a museum space that was at once imposing and welcoming, comfortable and beautiful, and as much a work of art as the treasures it would contain. With Chamber, we add yet another treasure to the Kimbell's collection."," Aquatic plants, Spanish moss, Mate",chamber first perfume create inspire think architecture analogy inspire architect louis kahns breathtake groundbreake kimbell art museum fort worth chamber scent dedicated explore interior space something impressively creative array material drawn every level natural world bottom vast lake high head represent museum abundance concrete marble glass grass solar light chamber employs fascinating blend green fresh mineralic spice note notably fondo de lago collection plant life harvest lake floor combine tree moss mate deliver sophisticated unpredictable green scent compelling depth emerge airiness evocative steady flow light across kimbells fame vault ceiling kahns genius design museum space impose welcome comfortable beautiful much work art treasure would contain chamber add yet another treasure kimbells collection

quilombo eau de parfum,Fueguia 1833," In colonial Brazil, Quilombos were synonymous of resistance and independence. Protected by a labyrinth of rivers and impenetrable forests, these fugitive worlds encapsulated an untouched tropical landscape. Mixing together native and African roots, a wild atmosphere emerged full of dances, rhythms and delicious flavours made from cupuacÃº and dulce de leche (a candied concentration made from burnt milk).  This is the scent of Quilombo, a mouthwatering treat that elevates the art of the milky gourmand beyond where we thought it could go. A sweet, creamy, ""how did they do that?""-level realistic hot milk accord wows our noses and tastebuds alike, while careful touches of vanilla and cane sugar supplement without overwhelming, keeping the composition specific and never in the realm of generic dessert scent. Long a symbol of hope, perseverance and joy in the face of oppression, Quilombos occupy an important place in Brazilian history.

la cautiva eau de parfum,Fueguia 1833," A heavenly musk laced with fruit and vanilla. La Cautiva meansThe Captive,  and it refers to an epic poem by Esteban Echeverria which is considered one of the first great works of modern Argentinian literature. This is an imaginative speculation about the scent of Mary, the main character, and while we have never read the poem, we can state unequivocally that she smelled delicious. This is airy and delectable  an enchanting confection that features a creamy whipped vanilla and a piercingly sweet black currant. The musk is soft spoken and warms to the skin as the edible elements come forward. Initially, there is a hint of syrup to the berries, but the intense sugar eases into a juicy, fresh currant with a hint of minty green leaves. As cloud-light and effortless as a meringue, topped with perfectly ripe berries - this is like a dessert you would eat in a dream.  The perfect warm weather gourmand."," Musk, blackcurrant, vanilla",heavenly musk lace fruit vanilla la cautiva meansthe captive refer epic poem esteban echeverria consider one first great work modern argentinian literature imaginative speculation scent mary main character never read poem state unequivocally smell delicious airy delectable enchanting confection feature creamy whip vanilla piercingly sweet black currant musk soft spoken warm skin edible element come forward initially hint syrup berry intense sugar ease juicy fresh currant hint minty green leave cloudlight effortless meringue top perfectly ripe berry like dessert would eat dream perfect warm weather gourmand
biblioteca de babel eau de parfum,Fueguia 1833," Cedar shelves, heavy leather bookbindings, vellum leaves, the smell of ink. The complex environment of an old book is brought to life. Named after a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, about an enormous library of interlocking rooms, housing a vast collection of books  this fragrance is about the intoxicating scent of an old library where the books have been kept impeccably dry. It is a combination of warm woods, leather bindings, and a hint of ink. The strongest element here is absolutely the wood  warm, reassuring cedar and a South American wood called cabreuva, which complements the cedar.  This is deep, burnished and luxurious. The first impression is waxy and surprisingly sweet. There is a rich tuberose-like note, like a flower pressed between the pages, and a dusting of cinnamon. Than we get the soft, worn leather of book bindings, the dry spiciness of old vellum and  a trace of tobacco. This is like the warm, comforting embrace of a favorite armchair, in a book-lined room. An instant favorite  we would love to spend a long time in this library."," Cedar, cabreuva (woody note), cinnamon",cedar shelf heavy leather bookbinding vellum leave smell ink complex environment old book bring life name short story jorge luis borges enormous library interlock room housing vast collection book fragrance intoxicate scent old library book keep impeccably dry combination warm wood leather binding hint ink strong element absolutely wood warm reassure cedar south american wood call cabreuva complement cedar deep burnish luxurious first impression waxy surprisingly sweet rich tuberoselike note like flower press page dusting cinnamon get soft wear leather book binding dry spiciness old vellum trace tobacco like warm comfort embrace favorite armchair bookline room instant favorite would love spend long time library
panthea eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," How do you picture the scent of heaven? Forget about the specificity of religion, and focus only on the general concept: a pearly-white paradise above the clouds, clean and enveloping, mysterious yet sublimely blissful. This is the scent of Panthea, a fresh, feminine, iris-driven addition to the 777 series imbued with an almost transcendent sense of grace. Pathea opens with an energetic sense of freshness, balancing the gentle juiciness of tangerine against the sparkle of pink pepper with a sweepingly smooth white tea providing a pristine backdrop. The heart of iris has plenty of compelling powdery floral character, but also a softness that eschews rooty or earthy tones in favor of delightfully lush white florals and muskiness. A delicate balance of light woods, tonka and patchouli lend longevity without bulk- the scent is weightless throughout. Spend a day in the clouds with Panthea- we doubt you'll ever want to come back to earth."," Bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli",picture scent heaven forget specificity religion focus general concept pearlywhite paradise cloud clean envelop mysterious yet sublimely blissful scent panthea fresh feminine irisdriven addition 777 series imbue almost transcendent sense grace pathea open energetic sense freshness balance gentle juiciness tangerine sparkle pink pepper sweepingly smooth white tea provide pristine backdrop heart iris plenty compelling powdery floral character also softness eschews rooty earthy tone favor delightfully lush white floral muskiness delicate balance light wood tonka patchouli lend longevity without bulk scent weightless throughout spend day cloud panthea doubt ever want come back earth

mem eau de parfum,Bogue Profumo," Not since AimÃ¨ Guerlain created Jicky in 1889 has a perfumer done something so radical to lavender. Antonio Gardoni takes the sunny herb from its kitchen garden setting and passes it through clay, wood, minerals, burned sugar, and wax so that a new form emerges, like steel forged by the elements. MEM contains all the hallmark Bogue signatures but represents a clear step forward in complexity even from the masterpiece that is Maai.MEM opens up on a dark lavender note that smells less like fresh herbs and more like clay and cepes. Sunshine soon arrives in the form of hops, toasted malt, and the pale ale fizz of aldehydes, lifting the scent out of its humus-rich opening. The scorched-sugar of ethyl maltol caramelizes the lavender, creating a phantom accord of fruit like the dark, almost calcified contents of a forgotten jar of peach marmalade. But as soon as the mind adjusts to this accord, MEM shifts again, this time into a rich floral heart of jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang that sacrifices prettiness for the more interesting facets of wax, gasoline, and rubber. Indian sandalwood with its wheaten milkiness and Himalayan cedarwood with its lingering note of woodsmoke work in tandem to ease the florals and aromatics into the base. The drydown, which is sturdy and beautiful, weaves the sweet dust of unlit incense into the musky, salty, animalic base of a barbershop fougere. MEM is not a perfume that lends itself to easy interpretation, it will reward your patience a hundred times over. In terms of who can wear it, MEM is something of a chimera: sometimes it seems masculine, at others, feminine. Beautiful, quixotic, and memorable, we think this is artisanal perfumery at its most daring."," Petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender (4 different species), ylang ylang, lily of the valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose damascena, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, Siam benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, Himalayan cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber",not since aima guerlain create jicky 1889 perfumer something radical lavender antonio gardoni take sunny herb kitchen garden set pass clay wood mineral burn sugar wax new form emerge like steel forge element mem contain hallmark bogue signature represent clear step forward complexity even masterpiece maai mem open dark lavender note smell less like fresh herbs like clay cepes sunshine soon arrive form hops toast malt pale ale fizz aldehyde lift scent humusrich opening scorchedsugar ethyl maltol caramelize lavender create phantom accord fruit like dark almost calcify content forget jar peach marmalade soon mind adjust accord mem shift time rich floral heart jasmine rise ylang ylang sacrifice prettiness interesting facet wax gasoline rubber indian sandalwood wheaten milkiness himalayan cedarwood linger note woodsmoke work tandem ease floral aromatics base drydown sturdy beautiful weave sweet dust unlit incense musky salty animalic base barbershop fougere mem not perfume lend easy interpretation reward patience hundred time term wear mem something chimera sometimes seem masculine feminine beautiful quixotic memorable think artisanal perfumery dare
delma eau de parfum,Widian," The Dalma Island lies just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.  It's known for its pearl trade and famous for its pearl divers and legends of buried treasure left behind by ""pearl pirates.""     Widian uses the images and stories of Dalma Island as inspiration for one of its softest, sweetest compositions yet. Leather and marshmallow shape a base that is as delicious as it is fresh. It creates the foundation for Delma's creaminess, which never crosses fully into the gourmand category,  but rather is contrasted by resinous guaiac and fresh green galbanum. The peach-laced floral heart of the composition is balanced by a dusting of saffron and nutmeg. Delma's contrasting notes are masterfully blended into the olfactive equivalent of the smooth, iridescent texture of a pearl.  Shimmering, sweet and irresistible."," Mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow",dalma island lie coast abu dhabi know pearl trade famous pearl diver legends bury treasure left behind pearl pirate widian use image story dalma island inspiration one soft sweetest composition yet leather marshmallow shape base delicious fresh create foundation delmas creaminess never crosse fully gourmand category rather contrast resinous guaiac fresh green galbanum peachlace floral heart composition balance dusting saffron nutmeg delmas contrast note masterfully blend olfactive equivalent smooth iridescent texture pearl shimmering sweet irresistible

aqaysos eau de parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," What is the scent of crystalline wood? This concept,  of the strange geometry that might exist somewhere between nature's most versatile material and one of it's most fascinatingly exact,  is what inspired Pierre Guillaume to create Aqaysos,  a scent which casts a fascinatingly illusive prism that alternates between spicy,  fruity and woody notes. The result is an elusive,  versatile and sneakily powerful fragrance that wears like a suave,  modern,  and refreshing take on a certain wildly popular fruit-inflected masculine. Which isn't to say Aqaysos is another dull Aventus knockoff. In fact,  quite the opposite- while the juicy,  explosively fresh lime and bergamot opening is sure to delight,  it's cut with an aromatic dose of coriander,  lending a metallic quality to it,  at once mathematically precise and yet intriguingly otherworldly. A unique heart of little-used sansho berry,  with its lemon-peppery spiciness,  adds fiery depth to the sweet,  juicy blackcurrant. And growing ever stronger as it dries,  a robustly woodsy and musky base is given subtly bitter power with a dose of cocoa bean,  which asserts itself in unexpected rhythms. Lovers of fresh,  fruit-and-wood driven masculine scents will surely find a new go-to with Aqaysos. But this fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets all its own.A first for the Huitieme Art collection,  Aqaysos is presented in a unique ""Shadow Flacon, "" with the iconic Parfumerie Generale silhouette blacked out by an interior ceramic coating."," Lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musks, cocoa beans",scent crystalline wood concept strange geometry may exist somewhere nature versatile material one fascinatingly exact inspire pierre guillaume create aqaysos scent casts fascinatingly illusive prism alternates spicy fruity woody note result elusive versatile sneakily powerful fragrance wear like suave modern refreshing take certain wildly popular fruitinflecte masculine not say aqaysos another dull aventus knockoff fact quite opposite juicy explosively fresh lime bergamot opening sure delight cut aromatic dose coriander lending metallic quality mathematically precise yet intriguingly otherworldly unique heart littleuse sansho berry lemonpeppery spiciness add fiery depth sweet juicy blackcurrant grow ever strong dry robustly woodsy musky base give subtly bitter power dose cocoa bean assert unexpected rhythms lover fresh fruitandwood drive masculine scent surely find new goto aqaysos fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secret first huitieme art collection aqaysos present unique shadow flacon iconic parfumerie generale silhouette black interior ceramic coat
il tempo delle mele eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," Ask what region has the best food in Italy and you're bound to hear some profound disagreements- after all, we're talking about the gastronomic center of the universe- but we'd be willing to bet that Emilia-Romagna comes up more often than most. The northern region that contains Bologna, Modena, and Parma is certainly a culinary powerhouse, one that Parma native Hilde Soliani has visited in her work before, but with Il Tempo delle Melle, her ode to Emilia-born chef Igles Corelli, Soliani opts for a simple, mouthwatering local delicacy- the torta di mele ferrarrese, a basic but luscious apple cake enjoyed by everyone from kids to grandparents. But as Hilde's to-die-for gourmands have always taught us, simple doesn't have to mean boring, and Il Tempo, with its vibrant, juicy tart apple, creamy vanilla, and warm, mouthwateringly lactic milk note that emerges more and more as the fragrance dries. While we weren't lucky enough to grow up in Emilia-Romagna, this scent nevertheless has a Proustian nostalgia to it, evoking images of warm family gatherings overlooking the Adriatic.

hot milk eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," What, exactly, is Hot Milk? One sniff and you'll realize that's not an easy question to answer. Sure, there's an intensely electric burst of resinous black pepper, nose-tingling cinnamon, and even an undercurrent of insidiously scalding chili oil, but leave it to Hilde Soliani to balance all of that firepower on top of a pitch-perfect milk note that soothes the spirit and ignites our sense of childhood with a wondrously cool creaminess. And what do those two opposite elements add up to? It seems like each time we put it on our skin, we pick up yet another facet- sometimes the energetic pepper dominates, other times the smooth gourmand aspects, and often still the two synthesize into something that resembles a rich, fascinating woodsiness. What we do know for sure- this is undeniably a Hilde scent."," Milk, hot pepper",exactly hot milk one sniff realize not easy question answer sure intensely electric burst resinous black pepper nosetingling cinnamon even undercurrent insidiously scald chili oil leave hilde soliani balance firepower top pitchperfect milk note soothes spirit ignites sense childhood wondrously cool creaminess two opposite element add seem like time put skin pick yet another facet sometimes energetic pepper dominate time smooth gourmand aspect often still two synthesize something resemble rich fascinating woodsiness know sure undeniably hilde scent
carnicure (formerly l'animal sauvage) eau de parfum,Marlou," Wow. Carnicure is one naughty little kitty. In case you've been looking for it, Carnicure is the sweet spot between the ferocious dirtiness of Serge Lutens Muscs Kublai Khan, the smutty florals of Kiehl's, and the milky innocence of Helmut Lang EDP. In other words, this one is not only gorgeous, not only elegant, but above all exceedingly sexy.A brief flash of flowers - orange blossom and violet  set the mood for passion, and before we know it we're lying on a massive bed piled high with animal pelts in front of an open fire in an ancient castle. The deep, civety funk of the fur mingles with the smells of desire- salt, sweat, skin, and human fur. But an echo of the sugared flower petals and milky sandalwood still glows through the haze of musk, gently suggestive of the comfort of a lovers' bathing ritual. Innocence lost, and then regained  over and over again. This right here is the smell of human intimacy.Update: Carnicure is a new and improved version of the L'animal sauvage, slightly reworked to deliver a newly focused base that incorporates touches of vanilla, sandalwood, ambergris, and labdanum. It's slightly less fruity than the original, but its deeply sensual spirit is unchanged."," Orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum",wow carnicure one naughty little kitty case look carnicure sweet spot ferocious dirtiness serge lutens muscs kublai khan smutty floral kiehls milky innocence helmut lang edp word one not gorgeous not elegant exceedingly sexy brief flash flower orange blossom violet set mood passion know lie massive bed pile high animal pelt front open fire ancient castle deep civety funk fur mingle smell desire salt sweat skin human fur echo sugar flower petal milky sandalwood still glow haze musk gently suggestive comfort lover bathing ritual innocence lose regain right smell human intimacy update carnicure new improve version lanimal sauvage slightly rework deliver newly focus base incorporates touch vanilla sandalwood ambergris labdanum slightly less fruity original deeply sensual spirit unchanged

rahele eau de parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Over the course of the mid-1600s, three intrepid Frenchmen- named Bernier, Tavernier and ThÃ©venot- ventured separately into the heart of Mughal India, seeking fortune, adventure, discovery and opportunity. Their multitude of experiences, from serving in the royal court to trading for the legendary Tavernier (Hope) Diamond, become three individual travelogues, which thrilled and educated audiences back in Europe and informed centuries of European obsession with Eastern art and culture.

sweet parmesan violet eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," Life in Hilde Soliani's hometown of Parma, Italy, is possibly as close to paradise on Earth as one can get. The gorgeous, historic streets thrum with vibrant but never crowded pedestrian energy (and the occasional hometown-founded Lamborghini), the culture is relaxed yet saturated with the contributions of some of the world's most renowned artists, composers and designers, and the wine, cheese, and prosciutto are the best in all of the country. To honor this remarkable city, Hilde Soliani created Sweet Parmesan Violet, a delectable confection inspired by her native city's predilection for eating the petals of the native-grown Violetta di Parma with a dusting of sugar as a sweet treat.

oud orange intense eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," A beautiful rendering of a dark chocolate Mounds bar in perfume form. The opening notes of Oud Orange Intense are smoky and nutty, bringing to mind a pile of coconut husks smoldering in the ashes of a fire. Creamy musks and bourbon vanilla bring a cocoa-tinted softness to the mix, restraining the beachy exuberance of the coconut, and also its sweetness. What emerges is a dry, woody vanilla with a luxuriously boozy touch, like a log of driftwood rubbed lightly with coconut liquor. The oud note here is less of a headlining note than a calming influence on the other notes. Its austere woodiness turns what could have been a full-on, coconutty tropical extravaganza into an adult woody vanilla.

oud noir intense eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Unlike the majority of orientals calledintense ornoir, Oud Noir Intense actually lives up to its name.

sahraa oud eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Despite its desert inspiration, Sahraa Oud is a perfume that is as placidly, richly golden as a piece of Bvlgari costume jewelry. Featuring a large dollop of the real oud oil that Fragrance du Bois sources directly from its plantations in Asia, its soft but feral aroma is cushioned by layers of sweet, orangey amber, sandalwood, and roses  essentially a dab of oud buried deep within the folds of Fendi's Theorema.  Warm, soft, and almost waxy in its roundness, this is a scent that gives off the satiny glow of an aged wine. A touch of inky moss and spicy saffron lends Sahraa Oud a chypre touch, giving the waxy amber a faintly bitter, pleasing bite, like the patina on old wood. Rather than the desert, Sahraa Oud brings us to a backstreet in Tokyo, its velvety darkness lit by strings of glowing red and orange lanterns."," rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud",despite desert inspiration sahraa oud perfume placidly richly golden piece bvlgari costume jewelry feature large dollop real oud oil fragrance du bois source directly plantation asia soft feral aroma cushion layer sweet orangey amber sandalwood rose essentially dab oud bury deep within fold fendis theorema warm soft almost waxy roundness scent give satiny glow aged wine touch inky moss spicy saffron lend sahraa oud chypre touch give waxy amber faintly bitter pleasing bite like patina old wood rather desert sahraa oud bring us backstreet tokyo velvety darkness lit strings glow red orange lantern

oud bleu intense eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Oud Bleue Intense does indeed have a strangelyblue vibe to it. Bracing and intense, its mixture of marine air, earth, truffles, and ozone is simply intoxicating.

black i parfum extrait,Widian," The original fragrance from Widian by AJ Arabia, Black I distinguishes itself from the flock of Euro/Oriental hybrids in a key way: while inspired by the grandeur of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and rich with perfectly blended spices, Black I is not an ode to opulence.

A heart of delicate incense and smooth cypress adds sophistication and depth, while the drydown of musky sandal and cedar contributes longevity and a sexy modern backbone.

bois lumiere eau de parfum,Anatole Lebreton," It is a uniquely French ability to find the romantic sophistication in almost anything, including the inhospitable climate of Mediterranean garrigue land in drought season- climate that inspired the creation of Bois Lumiere.

alchemico eau de parfum,Mazzolari," The Mazzolari line has always embraced duality: a century of history but a newcomer to the niche fragrance scene, classic influences but modern compositions, Italian style and global influence. Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. Alchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense's rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back aloft, adding a lightly sweet undertone that floats the floral woodsiness to the surface yet again. As with any bout of alchemy, choosing the ingredients is only the beginning. It's the blend where the magic gets made."," Rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber",mazzolari line always embrace duality century history newcomer niche fragrance scene classic influence modern composition italian style global influence alchemico name appropriately suggest fusion mazzolari suitably dreamlike yet contemporary incense scent classical leaning thoroughly modern flourish alchemico open instantly compelling top note combine fresh young rise smooth cypress jolt energize crisp pepper blend seamlessly compelling effect heart main incense note hit steady beat almost immediately play pepper feel languidly smokey energetic earthy geranium note flesh incense rougher deeply facet drydown accentuate even spicy grassy vetiver note seem like alchemico may go far towards earth soft warm amber send back aloft add lightly sweet undertone float floral woodsiness surface yet bout alchemy choose ingredient begin blend magic get make

Now, Mazzolari honors both family and history with Augusto, a fresh, invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate for a gentleman of any era. Augusto opens with a tart, sparkling dose of bergamot and orange, made cool and refreshing with a spike of mint.

o/e eau de parfum,Bogue Profumo," Like any great architect, Antonio Gardoni is obsessed with structure and balance, and the concept that any fragrance, no matter how big and complex, can stand on the head of a pin if the engineering is sound. So it should come as no surprise that O/E, Bogue Profumo's followup to last year's sensational Maai and Cologne Reloaded, is, like its predecessors, a paradox- an elaborately structured, hugely complicated edifice of bright, shining citruses, naturally green spices and florals, warm natural wood notes and sheer synthetic ones, and an underpinning of smoky animalic notes- all of which somehow lock together to form something bright, surprisingly light, and cheerfully uncategorizable.  The combinations are exquisite- an ultra-fresh bergamot opening stands atop a spicy, fresh herb garden of rosemary and thyme. Balsamic camphor cools off a bough of juniper, pine and cypress. A lilt of lush florals offset a benzoin-tinged resinousness, and a transluscent layer of iso-E super wraps it all together and marks the composition as unmistakably 21st century. Each bold stroke is effortlessly complimented with the kind of artistic and architectural virtuosity that balances, but never overlaps, leaving the finished product as impressive in its scope as it is wonderfully enjoyable. Halfway between acoustic and electric, digital and analogue, artisanal and industrial, indoors and outdoors, O/E is another triumph from a truly contemporary talent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, Lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood",like great architect antonio gardoni obsess structure balance concept fragrance no matter big complex stand head pin engineering sound come no surprise e bogue profumos followup last year sensational maai cologne reload like predecessor paradox elaborately structure hugely complicated edifice bright shine citruses naturally green spice floral warm natural wood note sheer synthetic one underpinning smoky animalic note somehow lock together form something bright surprisingly light cheerfully uncategorizable combination exquisite ultrafresh bergamot opening stand atop spicy fresh herb garden rosemary thyme balsamic camphor cool bough juniper pine cypress lilt lush floral offset benzointinge resinousness transluscent layer isoe super wraps together marks composition unmistakably 21st century bold stroke effortlessly compliment kind artistic architectural virtuosity balance never overlap leave finish product impressive scope wonderfully enjoyable halfway acoustic electric digital analogue artisanal industrial indoor outdoors e another triumph truly contemporary talent
asphalt rainbow scratch & sniff sticker set,Charenton Macerations," Limited Edition Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Stickers.Asphalt Rainbow draws inspiration from the ""break the rules"" attitude of global street art: a creative world movement that teaches anything can be a canvas and anyone an artist. Specifically exploring the concepts of distortion, reappropriation, and impermanence, Asphalt Rainbow borrows from a series of masterful street art techniques to craft an olfactive love letter to the street: a roughed up rose that's been hyper-colored, torn apart and twisted on its head, then nailed to the wall for your sniffing pleasure. The arc of the fragrance mirrors the unpredictable lifecycle of street art: a re-envisioned rose accord that distorts and morphs over time like a fragmented floral collage stretched across urban walls and alleyways; its aerosol-tinged aroma ever-fading closer to background."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Spray Paint (Aerosols), Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Detritus, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",limited edition asphalt rainbow scratch sniff sticker asphalt rainbow draws inspiration break rule attitude global street art creative world movement teach anything canvas anyone artist specifically explore concept distortion reappropriation impermanence asphalt rainbow borrow series masterful street art technique craft olfactive love letter street rough rise hypercolore tear apart twisted head nail wall sniff pleasure arc fragrance mirror unpredictable lifecycle street art reenvisione rise accord distort morphs time like fragmented floral collage stretch across urban wall alleyways aerosoltinge aroma everfade close background
asphalt rainbow eau de parfum,Charenton Macerations," Asphalt Rainbow, a tribute to the creativity, spontaneity and political bravery of modern urban street art, succeeds in much the same way that its predecessor Christopher Street did: it's a high-concept, passionate, literate fragrance that, at the end of the day, smells both unique and just plain good. Drawing on the concepts of distortion, reappropriation and impermanence that inform street artists from Blek le Rat to Retna, Asphalt Rainbow takes a universally known perfume note- the rose- and puts it through an impressive bag of artists' tricks, presenting a rose that seems both unnaturally vivid but also surprisingly well-structured, as if stenciled with day-glo spraypaint. A distinct aerosol note lingers above it, and quickly a whole modern cityscape follows- damp pavement, auto exhaust, street food, brick walls, and the fleeting scents of a million strangers brushing past one another in a hurry to anywhere but where they are at this exact moment. That rose brings us back for sniff after sniff, daring us to separate it from the city on whose back it lives, until we realize that we can't- that the city and the flower are one and the same, faded into one another. Fresh, captivating, distinctly modern and urban, Asphalt Rainbow is not only a worthy follow-up to Christopher Street, but also confirmation that Charenton Macerations is a house of true skill and vision."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",asphalt rainbow tribute creativity spontaneity political bravery modern urban street art succeed much way predecessor christopher street highconcept passionate literate fragrance end day smell unique plain good draw concept distortion reappropriation impermanence inform street artist blek le rat retna asphalt rainbow take universally know perfume note rise put impressive bag artist trick present rise seem unnaturally vivid also surprisingly wellstructure stencil dayglo spraypaint distinct aerosol note linger quickly whole modern cityscape follow damp pavement auto exhaust street food brick wall fleeting scent million stranger brush past one another hurry anywhere exact moment rise bring us back sniff sniff dare us separate city whose back life realize not city flower one fade one another fresh captivate distinctly modern urban asphalt rainbow not worthy followup christopher street also confirmation charenton maceration house true skill vision
cristallo di rocca eau de parfum,Omnia Profumo," Rock crystal (also known as quartz) has long captured human imagination not in spite of its unadulterated beauty, but because of it: as one of the earliest forms of jewelry, its striking clarity and natural facets made it a prized accessory long before modern gemstone cutting and polishing methods came into vogue.

A soft base of sandalwood and creamy vanilla is like the exquisite but understated setting, providing sophisticated contrast. Like your fragrance, your jewelry of choice makes a statement about your character.

christopher street eau de parfum,Charenton Macerations," Home to merchants and misfits, Beatniks and Bohemians, dissidents and protesters, New York City's Christopher Street has established a reputation for celebrating rugged and rebellious individualism. Like the unique architecture of the street's triangular-shaped Northern Dispensary, Christopher Street introduces a distinctive fragrance structure that challenges traditional olfactive notions of gender. Unlike unisex fragrances that target a lowest common denominator (i.e. choosing the least offensive, neutered ingredients for formulation), Christopher Street revels in the unexpected harmonies of its strong masculine and feminine notes. The fragrance combines classical floral chypre elements with more subversive tones of metals, smoky tobacco, watered down alcohol, wet woods and clove."," Alcoholic lime, bergamot, bitter orange, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove bud, orange blossom, poet carnation, incense, moss, musk, myrrh, patchouli.",home merchant misfit beatniks bohemian dissident protester new york citys christopher street establish reputation celebrate rugged rebellious individualism like unique architecture street triangularshape northern dispensary christopher street introduce distinctive fragrance structure challenge traditional olfactive notion gender unlike unisex fragrance target low common denominator ie choose least offensive neuter ingredient formulation christopher street revel unexpected harmony strong masculine feminine note fragrance combine classical floral chypre element subversive tone metal smoky tobacco water alcohol wet wood clove
rudis eau de parfum,Nobile 1942," In ancient Rome, therudis was the wooden practice sword of a gladiator, worn into the arena as a symbol of his strength and valor. With Rudis, Nobile 1942 brings us a full portrait of one such ancient warrior, garbed in hardened leather armor, his sword adorned with flowers for courage and luck, fortified with wine and spirits for the battle that awaits. Rudis opens with an opulent blend of whiskey and leather, infused with tart fruits, smoky wood, buttery saffron, and the golden sweetness of immortelle. The leather feels as supple as expensive calfskin, but its luxuriousness has a sensual side from the musk and ambered warmth. A streak of red wine runs through the base, alongside roses redolent with patchouli and spice, balancing the raw masculinity of the opening notes and making Rudis feel both unisex and surprisingly modern. Sweet and spicy, golden and creamy, smoky and earthy, Rudis is an utterly intoxicating stitch in time connecting Europe's past, present, and future in an undeniably captivating fragrance."," bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk and incense",ancient rome therudis wooden practice sword gladiator wear arena symbol strength valor rudis nobile 1942 bring us full portrait one ancient warrior garbed harden leather armor sword adorn flower courage luck fortified wine spirit battle awaits rudis open opulent blend whiskey leather infuse tart fruit smoky wood buttery saffron golden sweetness immortelle leather feel supple expensive calfskin luxuriousness sensual side musk ambere warmth streak red wine run base alongside rose redolent patchouli spice balance raw masculinity opening note make rudis feel unisex surprisingly modern sweet spicy golden creamy smoky earthy rudis utterly intoxicate stitch time connect europe past present future undeniably captivate fragrance

maai eau de parfum,Bogue Profumo," Maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. It opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. The plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before IFRA/EU regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. Musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary Kouros or Muscs Koublai Khan. As Maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. At the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. In its drydown, Maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.We found Maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. A symphonic masterpiece in the vein of Jubilation 25 and Kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. Black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. Maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. Yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. Maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur."," tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss.",maai stunning accomplishment modern perfumery marrie good oldschool chypre glamour bold animalics refined elegance smoothness open burst incredibly mossy greenness fuse rose jasmine green tuberose sprinkle transparent veil golden glitter aldehyde plush bouquet mesmerize depth harkens back time ifra eu regulation truly heartstopping combine animalic element musky leather skanky cast mighty roar transform delicate swirl feminine floral something unisex masculine touch appeal fan legendary kouros muscs koublai khan maai unfold balsamic resin awaken base add subtle streaks smokiness honey sweetness time amber slowly turn whole fragrance deeply rich soft coat musky leather warmth tame skanky cry drydown maai transform golden velvet smooth plush mix amber musk oakmoss find maai one bold sophisticated chypre encounter symphonic masterpiece vein jubilation 25 kouros not fragrance faint heart mourned loss vintage glamour animalic edge blacktie gala seem like perfect occasion incredibly opulent concentrated scent moment want seduce naked sensuality maais unconventional heart beat wildness passion feel almost alive yet end day everything pale luxurious oakmoss pile lavish layer take breath away maai epitome sophistication grand tradition haute perfumery sure timeless beauty impress even jade connoisseur
she shihan eau de parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," If Piotr Czarnecki's instant cult hit Shihan (formerly called Sensei) was an ode to the perfumer's roots as a professional ballroom dancer- sensual, balanced, and unexpectedly muscular- then SHE Shihan could rightfully be thought of as an even more elegant, unabashedly feminine ballet.

In the heart of the fragrance, the original's myrrh and frankincense are rounded out with an exquisite, slightly chocolately plum and floral notes of violet and rose petal. While the drydown still features a sweet, shimmering labdanum and ambrette base, the addition of extra vanilla keeps SHE Shihan carefully walking the line between classically rich and surprisingly sexy.No matter what aspect of this gracefully sweet, gorgeously captivating fragrance appeals the most, we're positive that Piotr Czarnecki has yet again stolen our hearts."," Plum, violet, rose, tobacco, incense, spices, vanilla",piotr czarneckis instant cult hit shihan formerly call sensei ode perfumer root professional ballroom dancer sensual balance unexpectedly muscular shihan could rightfully think even elegant unabashedly feminine ballet build original unisex oriental gourmand note tobacco whiskey vanilla spice shihan glide confidently world womens scent add sweet fresh garden rise still beguilingly spice opening heart fragrance original myrrh frankincense round exquisite slightly chocolately plum floral note violet rise petal drydown still feature sweet shimmering labdanum ambrette base addition extra vanilla keep shihan carefully walk line classically rich surprisingly sexy no matter aspect gracefully sweet gorgeously captivate fragrance appeal positive piotr czarnecki yet steal heart

2022 generation homme eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," 2022 represents an important year for the future of the Middle East: as Qatar will play host to the World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon a great gathering in the heart of the region, an event that, at best, has the potential to demonstrate true sharing among more developed nations and states that are still struggling. Against this backdrop, Stephane Humbert Lucas presents 2022 Generation Man, a fragrance that employs a unique blend of timeless opulence and sleek modernity to represent the distinct character of today's sophisticated Middle Eastern man.2022 Generation Man opens with an unexpectedly bright burst of juicy blackcurrant and zesty yuzu, kept cool with a spritz of fresh mint. It's a wonderful twist for those expecting a by-the-numbers oud and spices, establishing a portrait of a modern young Middle Easterner prepared to greet the global community with as much style and warmth as imposing sophistication. The oud, of course, is present; a fabulously rich heart made from prized Cambodian agarwood of such rare distinction that it can hardly be compared to the synthetically sharp or pungently sour ouds of lesser brands. This is an oud that asserts its own value, dry and distinguished, powerful and almost translucent, connecting the fragrance to an unbroken line of tradition without ever dragging the composition backwards. As a base of rich spices and warm balsamic musk swell in support, the timeless luxury of Middle Eastern perfumery blends seamlessly with modern creativity for a sexy, sophisticated scent any man could wear with confidence.  Presented in a beautiful black lacquered bottle with a handcrafted gold cap, 2022 Generation Man is more than just a striking fragrance; it's a masterful statement."," Yuzu zest, blackcurrant, mint, Cambodian oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes.",2022 represent important year future middle east qatar play host world cup eye world upon great gather heart region event good potential demonstrate true share among develop nation state still struggle backdrop stephane humbert lucas present 2022 generation man fragrance employs unique blend timeless opulence sleek modernity represent distinct character today sophisticated middle eastern man 2022 generation man open unexpectedly bright burst juicy blackcurrant zesty yuzu keep cool spritz fresh mint wonderful twist expect bythenumber oud spice establish portrait modern young middle easterner prepare greet global community much style warmth impose sophistication oud course present fabulously rich heart make prize cambodian agarwood rare distinction hardly compare synthetically sharp pungently sour ouds less brand oud assert value dry distinguished powerful almost translucent connect fragrance unbroken line tradition without ever drag composition backwards base rich spice warm balsamic musk swell support timeless luxury middle eastern perfumery blend seamlessly modern creativity sexy sophisticated scent man could wear confidence present beautiful black lacquer bottle handcraft gold cap 2022 generation man strike fragrance masterful statement
shihan eau de parfum,Piotr Czarnecki," A personal labor of love, Shihan is Piotr Czarnecki's tribute to the natural connection between fragrance and dance. As a professional ballroom dancer and dance instructor in his native Poland, Czarnecki had long employed a lifetime obsession with scentmaking to compose fragrances meant to accompany his routines and those of his students, to, in his words,create their own atmosphere. But while it may have been originally created for a select few students, Shihan, a warm, exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand, is simply too good to keep secret.  As with a finely crafted dance program, his fragrance (formerly called Sensei) weaves around its central composition with graceful fluidity, revealing wondrous new aspects with each passing moment. The foundation of exceptionally high quality, largely natural ingredients: in the opening, Cuban tobacco and bitter Arabic coffee lend earthy depth to a boozy warm whiskey accord, while colonial spices enliven a mysterious heart of frankincense and myrrh, evoking visions of grand, exotic opulence. A musky amber base purrs with carefully extracted labdanum and sweet ambrette, dreamily resinous.A perfect blend of lively spice and warm richness that will delight fans of gourmands and orientals alike."," Whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber and musk.",personal labor love shihan piotr czarneckis tribute natural connection fragrance dance professional ballroom dancer dance instructor native poland czarnecki long employ lifetime obsession scentmake compose fragrance mean accompany routine student wordscreate atmosphere may originally create select student shihan warm exquisitely balance oriental gourmand simply good keep secret finely craft dance program fragrance formerly call sensei weave around central composition graceful fluidity reveal wondrous new aspect pass moment foundation exceptionally high quality largely natural ingredient opening cuban tobacco bitter arabic coffee lend earthy depth boozy warm whiskey accord colonial spice enliven mysterious heart frankincense myrrh evoke vision grand exotic opulence musky amber base purrs carefully extract labdanum sweet ambrette dreamily resinous perfect blend lively spice warm richness delight fan gourmand oriental alike
black gemstone eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A fragrance named for the sacred cornerstone of the very center of the Grand Mosque of Mecca demands a refinement and respect for both subject and composition. But StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is no mere tourist, and Black Gemstone, through its captivatingly complex blend of myrrh, lemon and smoky incense, indeed inspires a profound respect bordering on wonderment. The Black Stone of Mecca is purported to have fallen directly from Heaven, and the ingredients of Black Gemstone are clearly intended to come as close to otherworldly as possible. Pristinely tart Italian lemon, rich Olibanum-derived incense and three hand-selected types of cedar are but a few of the treasured components, but the true centerpiece is an extraordinary myrrh, painstakingly distilled down into a resinous tar that, like the Black Stone itself, projects a presence that far exceeds its size. And like a true religious experience, Black Gemstone follows no linear path- from moment to the moment, the tartness of the lemon, smokiness of the incense and balsamic sweetness of the myrrh dance around one another with an unpredictability that promises to make each individual encounter profoundly unique.Presented in an elegantly understated black lacquered bottle, with a unique hand-milled black honeycomb top and a small faceted black Swarovski crystal."," Infusion of three cedars lemon, myrrh, tar, incense, teak, tonka.",fragrance name sacred cornerstone center grand mosque mecca demand refinement respect subject composition staphane humbert lucas no mere tourist black gemstone captivatingly complex blend myrrh lemon smoky incense indeed inspire profound respect bordering wonderment black stone mecca purport fall directly heaven ingredient black gemstone clearly intend come close otherworldly possible pristinely tart italian lemon rich olibanumderive incense three handselecte type cedar treasure component true centerpiece extraordinary myrrh painstakingly distil resinous tar like black stone project presence far exceed size like true religious experience black gemstone follow no linear path moment moment tartness lemon smokiness incense balsamic sweetness myrrh dance around one another unpredictability promise make individual encounter profoundly unique present elegantly understate black lacquer bottle unique handmilled black honeycomb top small facete black swarovski crystal
oumma eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas describes Oumma as a study of the contrasts of agarwood (oud), a substance he views with mystical reverence. A single sniff of Oumma can more than explain why: based around the finest Burmese oud and buttressed by Moroccan Rose, Egyptian jasmine and Peruvian Balsam, this fragrance is drawn from the rarest sources on the planet and yet, it hardly feels earthly at all. Instead, Oumma seems to rise from the ground, stretching out each extraordinary facet of its central ingredient until the smoky, spicy wood and subtly sharp, medicinal aphrodisiac properties that make up the duality of oud seem to exist simultaneously, suspended in mid-air. Simply put, Oumma is a fragrance that makes you look to the heavens.A dry, spicy rose and elegantly savory saffron hover beneath, but this is nothing like the lavish-yet-rote oud-rose pairings widely available elsewhere. Rather, these exceptional ingredients, each deserving of a starring role in a different composition, combine with smoke-saturated cade ash to build the earthly pyre from which this singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher.Even the bottle itself seems prepared to leave the ground: shiny and silver, as bright and reflective as the mid-day sky, finished with a polished silver cap and a Swarovskidiamond placed on the crown. We've never experienced an oud quite like this."," Egyptian jasmine, Moroccan rose, Peruvian balsam, balsam tolu, ashes of cade, Burmese oud, nagarmotha.",staphane humbert lucas describe oumma study contrast agarwood oud substance view mystical reverence single sniff oumma explain base around fine burmese oud buttress moroccan rise egyptian jasmine peruvian balsam fragrance drawn rare source planet yet hardly feel earthly instead oumma seem rise ground stretch extraordinary facet central ingredient smoky spicy wood subtly sharp medicinal aphrodisiac property make duality oud seem exist simultaneously suspend midair simply put oumma fragrance make look heavens dry spicy rise elegantly savory saffron hover beneath nothing like lavishyetrote oudrose pairing widely available elsewhere rather exceptional ingredient deserve star role different composition combine smokesaturate cade ash build earthly pyre singularly extraordinary oud may ascend even high even bottle seem prepare leave ground shiny silver bright reflective midday sky finish polished silver cap swarovskidiamond place crown never experienced oud quite like
rose de petra eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Petra: capital of the Nabataeans, a wonder of ancient engineering, an ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely into the side of the mountain thought to be the biblical Sinai itself. Words cannot hope to describe the majesty of the place known as the Rose City, but StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose a far more appropriate medium with Rose de Petra, a breathtaking floral that honors both halves of its namesake with a rose equal parts refreshingly natural and sumptuously mysterious. We like to think of Rose de Petra as a journey down an ancient stone canyon, with wild roses in full bloom springing from every crack in the rock. What begins as a simple, beautiful journey opens itself to mystery and wonder- that clean, bright rose we smell is no single, simple note but rather an intense rose oxide given body and mouthwatering juiciness from pomegranate and litchi. As the heart of pure, natural Bulgarian rose expands, so too do the spices- cardamom, cumin and pepper, intense enough to invigorate but light enough to place this scent a world away from a typical rose chypre. Here, yet again, we see the necessity of Lucas' uncompromising commitment to top quality ingredients, as Rose de Petra's deceptively simple formula belies an astounding integrity we would not have thought possible from reading the notes alone. Like a fully irrigated city carved into a mountain in the middle of the desert, Rose de Petra is a masterpiece of construction that will knock you over with its beauty.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal placed on the crown."," Rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds.",petra capital nabataeans wonder ancient engineering ornately beautiful kingdom carve entirely side mountain think biblical sinai word not hope describe majesty place know rise city staphane humbert lucas choose far appropriate medium rise de petra breathtake floral honor half namesake rise equal part refreshingly natural sumptuously mysterious like think rise de petra journey ancient stone canyon wild rose full bloom springing every crack rock begin simple beautiful journey open mystery wonder clean bright rise smell no single simple note rather intense rise oxide give body mouthwatere juiciness pomegranate litchi heart pure natural bulgarian rise expand spice cardamom cumin pepper intense enough invigorate light enough place scent world away typical rise chypre yet see necessity lucas uncompromising commitment top quality ingredient rise de petra deceptively simple formula belie astounding integrity would not think possible read note alone like fully irrigate city carve mountain middle desert rise de petra masterpiece construction knock beauty present genuine goldlettere transparent bottle adorn unique handmilled gold honeycomb top small facete peachcolore swarovski crystal place crown
soleil de jeddah eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, the Bride of the Red Sea, gateway to Mecca and Medina. To honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of Russian leather, Madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. Like the multi-faceted city of Jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. The initial brightness of Soleil de Jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft Roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. In fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that Soleil de Jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. Once the Russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. Like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the Jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results."," Lemon, Roman chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, Russian leather, vanilla from Madagascar.",place planet close relationship sun saudi arabian city jeddah bride red sea gateway mecca medina honor great city religious epicenter vacation destination cultural capital center commerce staphane humbert lucas choose focus one element equally present central endeavor contain within brilliant goldmetallic bottle sundrenched rapturously bright citrusfloral gradually evolve reveal hide depth russian leather madagascar vanilla buttery iris earthy amber like multifacete city jeddah reason go reason stay may entirely different initial brightness soleil de jeddah thing unapologetic beauty tart juicy lemon pillowsoft roman chamomile exquisite osmanthus mouthwateringly jammy variously detect peach apricot lychee mango albeit without cloy sweetness may accompany note less fragrance fact fragrance big bright minor miracle soleil de jeddah never deviate reductive sweetness overdone sour attribute exceptional quality ingredient well lightly powdery iris root heart seamlessly bridge gap earthy surprisingly sensual base russian leather emerge rich resinous slight smokiness may seem like strange unfamiliar progression natural intriguing deeply satisfy like beautiful handmilled golden honeycombed cap jeddah sun shine brightly enough bring everything together undeniably beautiful result
khol de bahrein eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," KhÃ´l: one of the world's earliest cosmetics and the essence of ancient beauty. Think Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra, immaculate jet-black lines of khÃ´l framing piercing violet eyes, infusing what was already stunning with near-mystical seductive power. KhÃ´l de Bahrein is a tribute to the elegance and ingenuity of the ancient world, where the untold balsamic depths of a sumptuous amber-benzene heart frame a strikingly lovely violet and iris led floral with masterful precision. KhÃ´l de Bahrein opens with complimentary waves of deep, resinous amber and an iris both richly earthy and subtly sweet. As the iris evolves to an almost candied sweetness, the violet and ambergris weave seamlessly in, lending a powdery softness that anchors without ever diluting. It is an exquisite balancing act achievable only with the finest natural iris and ambergris, highest-quality ingredients that also result in a projection and longevity impossible with mundane synthetics.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal, KhÃ´l de Bahrein is that rarest of treasures: a celebration of timeless beauty that proves itself equally beautiful, inside and out."," Violet, nougat, gums, iris powder, sandalwood, benzoin, amber, musky balsamic notes.",kha l one world early cosmetic essence ancient beauty think elizabeth taylor cleopatra immaculate jetblack line kha l frame pierce violet eye infuse already stunning nearmystical seductive power kha l de bahrein tribute elegance ingenuity ancient world untold balsamic depth sumptuous amberbenzene heart frame strikingly lovely violet iris lead floral masterful precision kha l de bahrein open complimentary wave deep resinous amber iris richly earthy subtly sweet iris evolve almost candy sweetness violet ambergris weave seamlessly lending powdery softness anchor without ever diluting exquisite balance act achievable fine natural iris ambergris highestquality ingredient also result projection longevity impossible mundane synthetic present genuine goldlettere transparent bottle adorn unique handmilled gold honeycomb top small facete peachcolore swarovski crystal kha l de bahrein rare treasure celebration timeless beauty prof equally beautiful inside
o hira eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," To say that O Hira is perhaps the finest amber fragrance in the world isn't so much a matter of opinion as it is a matter of pedigree. 777 creator and nose StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas became fixated on creating an amber scent that would spare no expense, cut no corner, in pursuit of the most precious ingredients on the globe. The process would end up taking him 2 years of dedicated work, but the result is nothing short of extraordinary: O Hira, the powerful, authentic scent of fossilized amber, a masterwork that Lucas considersthe diamond of the collection.There is no fragrance pyramid in O Hira, no notes given to consider outside of fossilized amber.

une nuit a doha eau de parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," While the 777 line is dedicated to paying tribute to the great cultures and natural ingredients of the Middle East, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is in no way fenced in by the conventions or styles of traditional middle eastern perfumery. And we're thankful for that, because Une Nuit Ã Doha, a soft, deliciously sweet immortelle and vanilla scent inspired by summer nights in the capital of Qatar, is nobody's idea of an indulgently rich Middle Eastern gourmand.Instead, it glows like a hazy, dreamlike moon, calm but deep, on a city night where the intensity of the day's heat has faded but not vanished. Warm winds carry the exotic scents of night markets: fennel, ginger, crystallized mandarin, while the sweetness of the immortelle blends into a comfortable brown tobacco from the neighborhood cafes, where games and conversations amongst old men run late into the night. As the base of creamy, beautiful vanilla absolute begins to warm, the fragrance hugs closer to the skin, drawing people together as the desert night seems to stretch on into eternity. This is seduction for adults- calm, assured, and utterly lovely.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal."," Fennel, crystallized mandarin, ginger, immortelle flower from Corsica, vetiver from HaÃ¯ti, brown tobacco, absolute of vanilla.",777 line dedicated pay tribute great culture natural ingredient middle east staphane humbert lucas no way fence convention style traditional middle eastern perfumery thankful une nuit doha soft deliciously sweet immortelle vanilla scent inspire summer night capital qatar nobodys idea indulgently rich middle eastern gourmand instead glow like hazy dreamlike moon calm deep city night intensity day heat fade not vanish warm wind carry exotic scent night market fennel ginger crystallized mandarin sweetness immortelle blend comfortable brown tobacco neighborhood cafe game conversation amongst old man run late night base creamy beautiful vanilla absolute begin warm fragrance hug close skin draw people together desert night seem stretch eternity seduction adult calm assure utterly lovely present genuine goldlettere transparent bottle adorn unique handmilled gold honeycomb top small facete peachcolore swarovski crystal
magnolia grandiflora - sandrine eau de parfum,Grandiflora," Perfume lovers have long admired the author of the fiercely original Manoumalia, Sandrine Videault, a maverick artist who chose to work only on compositions she believed in, hence her tiny commercial production. Sandrine left us last year at a tragically early age. Her last gift to us, and to the Australian floral designer Saskia Havekes, whose soul and world Sandrine fell in love with, is her Magnolia Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Sandrine is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by Michel Roudnitska, the son of Sandrine's mentors, Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se. While Michel's magnolia is lush and sensuous, this fragrance captures magnolia on a summer morning in its first, luminous stage: a dewy rose-tinged bud, shimmering with the tangy zest of a grapefruit note.It's probably the first time I detect a chypre accord in the flower, Sandrine wrote.I didn't know it existed in nature. For me, it was the most important thing to say about this Magnolia. Of course, this flower smells of lemon, and also conjures a certain moistness, but there are also fruity notes of melon, watermelon, earthy notes, etc.A pure, graceful fragrance with a zest for life."," Lemon, grapefruit, white pepper, fresh garden accords, dry wood accords, marine-aquatic accords, musky accords",perfume lover long admire author fiercely original manoumalia sandrine videault maverick artist choose work composition believe hence tiny commercial production sandrine left us last year tragically early age last gift us australian floral designer saskia havekes whose soul world sandrine fall love magnolia grandiflora magnolia grandiflora sandrine part pair fragrance dedicated grandifloras namesake blossom unusual debut fledgling brand vibrant emotional tribute story behind scent since magnolia compose michel roudnitska son sandrine mentor edmond thara se michel magnolia lush sensuous fragrance capture magnolia summer morning first luminous stage dewy rosetinge bud shimmering tangy zest grapefruit noteit probably first time detect chypre accord flower sandrine wrotei not know exist nature important thing say magnolia course flower smell lemon also conjure certain moistness also fruity note melon watermelon earthy note etc pure graceful fragrance zest life

Scott) who not only hid in the shadows of her husband, but also in her own cocoon of madness, Tendre Est La Nuit is a scent that references darkness' magnetic appeal and the sweet idleness of a wandering mind.Created with perfumer Delphine Thierry, the top notes of immortelle flower and ambrette resemble the intoxication of GewÃ¼rztraminer wine; herbaceous davana and bright pepper notes serve as a lovely contrast to the mahogany, incense, and animalic notes that make an impression of danger that lurks around in the shadows of the night."," Corsican immortelle, ambrette and carrot seeds, cabreuva, davana, pepper, Sichuan pepper, benzoin, leather, labdanum, oakmoss, incense, patchouli, castoreum",soft aromatic animalic tendre est la nuit evoke cozy sweet atmosphere may result indolence languor majda bekkaliwanted tell may opposite noisy turbulent world livebut extract noisy world danger lurks around reason falters animality emerge homage zelda fitzgerald wife f scott not hide shadow husband also cocoon madness tendre est la nuit scent reference darkness magnetic appeal sweet idleness wander mind create perfumer delphine thierry top note immortelle flower ambrette resemble intoxication gewa14rztraminer wine herbaceous davana bright pepper note serve lovely contrast mahogany incense animalic note make impression danger lurks around shadow night

ashoka eau de parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," Inspired by a legendary ruler, Neela Vermeire's Ashoka, is a tribute to an emperor who was conquered by his own compassion at the moment his victory was assured. He converted to Buddhism and devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Buddha's teachings, to truth, to justice and to compassion for all living creatures beneath the sun. His own evolution from ruthless conqueror to benevolent emperor is reflected in Ashoka's journey from the fierce opening to a softly floral heart & the gentle embrace of its richly complex dry down.Ashoka is many things at once - it melds green, milky, earthy, and watery floral notes into one enticing and multifaceted scent.  The opening is a refreshing fig leaf, hyacinth, and lotus - but as soon as you think that the scent is all watery and green, the creamy and earthy personality capture you like quicksand - pulling you in and helping you discover fig milk, osmanthus, heliotrope, sandalwood, and a hint of vanilla.  These notes provide a velvety lactic quality that is altogether unexpected and totally irresistible.

sicilian wood eau de parfum,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the scent of a citrus grove warming in the sun, Sicilian Wood is a quintessential Tom Daxon fragrance: powerfully evocative, fascinating in its evolution and, ultimately, equal parts surprising and satisfying. The opening is a vivid citrus that is instantly captivating.  The blend of lemon, tangerine and bergamot is startlingly realistic  you can feel that little squirt of juice as you peel off the skin of a tangerine.

resin sacra eau de parfum,Tom Daxon," A meditation on the beauty of the ambiguous nature of frankincense.  An evocative shape-shifter, this tantalizing blend takes advantage of the diversity of its central ingredient to offer an experience both cool and church-like, and warm and sensual. A honeyed suede  sweet, soft and rich  cradles the frankincense as it emerges, creating an air of delicious opulence as resinous swirls of benzoin and cistus meld with the frankincense, leading it away from the gothic chill of stone and ceremony and celebrating its mesmerizing sensuality. And yet as the fragrance warms on the skin, the sweetness becomes less pronounced, and the transporting, ethereal side of frankincense emerges. We never cross fully to the sacred side, but those aspects of this compelling note keep the luxury in balance. Gorgeous and mystical."," Suede, frankincense, patchouli, benzoin Siam, cistus, ambroxan, sandalwood, vetiver",meditation beauty ambiguous nature frankincense evocative shapeshifter tantalizing blend take advantage diversity central ingredient offer experience cool churchlike warm sensual honey suede sweet soft rich cradle frankincense emerge create air delicious opulence resinous swirls benzoin cistus meld frankincense lead away gothic chill stone ceremony celebrate mesmerize sensuality yet fragrance warm skin sweetness become less pronounce transport ethereal side frankincense emerge never cross fully sacred side aspect compelling note keep luxury balance gorgeous mystical

orgasmo eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," A swoon-inducing almond elixir that opens with a splash of Amaretto on the rocks.  Amaretto is the beloved Italian almond-flavored liqueur whose name meansa little bitter, which it definitely is. However, it is also a little sweet, with a cherry-like fruitiness that counters the bitterness. That elusive bittersweet quality is at the heart of almond's appeal and is the centerpiece of this compelling scent. The almond note is full and complex, stepping forward after the intoxicating sweetness of the opening subsides. There is a creamy, dough-like quality underneath  not sugary cookie dough, but rich and buttery bread dough laced with almonds and fruit, with a whisper of salt. There are many elements of a comfort scent here, but the insistent, tantalizing thrum of almond's dark side keeps this enticingly dangerous.  An undercurrent of dry, cool wood gives this the dusky feel of rough velvet and distant smoke.  According to Hilde, this was inspired by drinking iced almond coffee on the beach with good friends. All we can say is that must have been some really special coffee and some really nice friends, because this sensuous scent evokes a feeling of true euphoria. Orgasmo has that hypnotic effect where you always want to take one more sniff... just one more. A must have for almond lovers."," almond, amaretto liqueur accord",swooninduce almond elixir open splash amaretto rock amaretto beloved italian almondflavore liqueur whose name meansa little bitter definitely however also little sweet cherrylike fruitiness counter bitterness elusive bittersweet quality heart almond appeal centerpiece compelling scent almond note full complex step forward intoxicate sweetness opening subside creamy doughlike quality underneath not sugary cookie dough rich buttery bread dough lace almond fruit whisper salt many element comfort scent insistent tantalizing thrum almond dark side keep enticingly dangerous undercurrent dry cool wood give dusky feel rough velvet distant smoke accord hilde inspire drinking iced almond coffee beach good friend say must really special coffee really nice friend sensuous scent evoke feel true euphoria orgasmo hypnotic effect always want take one sniff one must almond lover

450 eau de parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," If we could smell the woods, meadows and flower garlands depicted in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera, their spring beauty might very well resemble 450 by Farmacia SS Annunziata, named after the 450 Jubilee of the ancient Farmacia, which was established in the year of 1561 in the San Nicolo monastery.450 gives the impression of being a rustic floral, the marriage of its notes joined together by the wind and sealed with kisses from the sun. With its brisk, aromatic citrus top notes, light rosy floral heart tempered by woods, and its ambery-musky base with a touch of incense, 450 is spring in all its rawness, freshness, and warmth. In the drydown, woodsy florals are softened by Florentine orris with its powdery, earthy gentleness and the ambery-vanillic sweetness of coumarin.A perfect unisex fragrance for hot weather, 450 could easily adorn (and cool off) the wearer of a seersucker suit or a white linen dress.

The splendid heart of oud and leather is gently softened by cedar and patchouli, giving it a comforting and resinous appeal.

And what a buzz Bombay Bling is, starting with the bang of a huge, raspy green mango before exploding into a vibrant, tropical blend of jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, plumeria and gardenia.This extravagantly lavish bouquet is rooted in wood and tobacco notes, which give it an intriguing hint of masculinity. Lads who feel they can rock white florals could give this a try.

mohur eau de parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name refers to the most valuable gold coin in India's history, the last of which was minted in 1918. A way, perhaps, of underlining the value given to perfumery during the Mogul era, an art so highly considered that the most powerful empress of the Mughal dynasty, Noor Jahan, devoted herself to perfecting it.Though Mohur is built on the classic Eastern accord of rose and oud, with its powdery orris accords it also manages to conjure the opulence of classic French fragrances. It is also, despite the richness of its floral accords, a unisex scent, with leather effects alluding to high tea after a polo match in the British Raj, and perhaps a whiff of fine-milled English soap.But the real surprise in Mohur is the subtle Indian pastry accord tucked in the petals of its rose garden, with notes of carrot, almond, cardamom and ambrette, lending a tender touch to this majestic composition.

trayee eau de parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name means ""triad"", an allusion to the sacred origin of the first three Vedas, the most ancient sacred texts in India. The notes are drawn from the ingredients used in religious rituals and ayurvedic medicine during the Vedic era. Rich in incense, myrrh and oud, the fragrance is a poignant blend of smoke, spices and resins that harks back to the very origins of perfumery  a burnt offering to the gods and an aid to meditation.Bertrand Duchaufour has always excelled at bringing transparency to dark resinous notes, and he surpasses himself in the smoky blend: Trayee is amazingly facetted, with green (basil, cardamom, cassis), floral (jasmine), spicy (ginger, cinnamon, clove), leather (saffron, oud), smoky (vetiver, sandalwood) and balsamic (myrrh, vanilla) effects, dominated by the quintessentially Indian fragrances of sandalwood and jasmine. The perfumer has even added an arrestingly realistic ganja accord, a memory of the sadus he ran across during his trips in India.Trayee's smoky tendrils may not have consciousness-altering effects, but we suspect that the gorgeous natural materials in the formula might be aromatherapeutic.

myrrhiad eau de parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," The amazingly prolific Pierre Guillaume adds a ninth scent to HuitiÃ¨me Art, a line dedicated to rare natural organic ingredients and original accords based on novelplant captures. But this time, instead of pear tree bark or organic Moroccan verbena, he tackles one of the most ancient and sacred aromatic ingredients known to mankind: myrrh.Myrrh resin is an olfactory world in itself, with bitter, ambery and balsamic facets. Guillaume, who has always had a bent for gourmand notes, amplifies those facets by matching them with a cocktail of vanillas to boost the balsamic effects. The cool burn of licorice draws the blend towards mouth-watering darkness shot with green glints of anise and milky almond plushness.But the real surprise springs from the splash of black tea absolute that soaks the bittersweet potion with smoky, tarry, almost animalic effects, and turn into a gloriously dark, smooth leather scent.Myrrhiad conjures the sacred and erotic origins of perfume.

oro eau de parfum,Omnia Profumo," The power of gold (oro) has tugged at the human soul for millennia, bringing with it intense emotions and indescribable beauty and artistry. Translating gold's majesty and possibilities from the senses of touch and sight to smell was a Herculean task, and one Omnia Profumo spared no expense in doing. Oro is a shaded glen dappled with golden light, scented with light touches of fresh lemon and bergamot that meld with a breeze carrying a zingy, wild cyclamen. The breeze picks up with a gust of peony, lavender and spring lilac, and bids farewell as a rich and sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds. The vanilla-like coumarin and exquisite sandalwood are perfect accompaniments-- you didn't think a perfume called Oro would be a coquettish giggle of a perfume, right?  Don't assume it's overly heavy or ostentatious; Oro is feminine and sexy without trying too hard, that just-right combo of sweet and dark that will have people running the wrong way down an escalator to ask you what you're wearing."," Lemon, Bergamot, Cyclamen, Lavender, Lilac, Peony, Patchouly Sandalwood, Coumarin, Incense, Vanilla",power gold oro tug human soul millennia bring intense emotion indescribable beauty artistry translating golds majesty possibility sense touch sight smell herculean task one omnia profumo spare no expense oro shaded glen dapple golden light scent light touch fresh lemon bergamot meld breeze carry zingy wild cyclaman breeze pick gust peony lavender spring lilac bid farewell rich sensual vanilla patchouli combination unfold vanillalike coumarin exquisite sandalwood perfect accompaniment not think perfume call oro would coquettish giggle perfume right not assume overly heavy ostentatious oro feminine sexy without try hard justright combo sweet dark people run wrong way escalator ask wear
conaffetto eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," A delightful, romantic filigree of almonds, sugar and soaringly lovely orange blossom. Created for a dear friend's wedding, Soliani was inspired byconfetti  the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy  and around the world.  You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower.  Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d'oranger  a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers. We can't imagine a more perfect scent for a wedding  but you don't need to be a bride to love this. Any time you want to dab on a dose of sheer joy, this would be appropriate."," Orange blossom, almond, sugar",delightful romantic filigree almond sugar soaringly lovely orange blossom create dear friend wedding soliani inspire byconfetti sugar coat almond candy serve wedding italy around world may know well jordan almond not easy meltinyourmouth sort candy sugarcoat convey wish newlywed life sweet bitter beauty candy almond really sharp bitterness contrast powdery sweetness beguile contradiction capture perfectly scent lead absolutely gorgeous profusion fresh orange blossom walk wedding bower conafetto feature absolutely radiant version fleur doranger touch honey touch citrus bounty ethereal white flower not imagine perfect scent wedding not need bride love time want dab dose sheer joy would appropriate
patchouli nobile eau de parfum,Nobile 1942," Let's face it: Patchouli can be maddening to describe because it smells like nothing else in the world but patchouli. Yes, it's earthy and rich, but those adjectives fail to conjure up the hypnotic, evocative qualities that make patchouli so distinctive. Luckily, if we simply state the obvious  Patchouli Nobile is a patchouli scent  we have a good place to begin because we all know that deep, highly recognizable note. The question is, is it a good patchouli scent? Happily, the answer is yes. In fact, it's not just a good patchouli scent, it's a great one: It seduces without resorting to brute force, it has a caressing amber-tinged sweetness that nestles into the loamy richness of clean earth and smooth wood and it retains the dry freshness of its opening of incense and pepper. It is both elegantly refined and devastatingly sexy. The patchouli is absolutely present, but it's not overpowering, and the layers of sandalwood, oak moss, amber and tonka add a luxurious, velvety quality that makes this superbly wearable. It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of patchouli, you need to try this, but we feel that this cozy and alluring scent has the potential to win new converts to the patchouli cult, as well. Outstanding."," Citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine Moroccan cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka.",let us face patchouli madden describe smell like nothing else world patchouli yes earthy rich adjective fail conjure hypnotic evocative quality make patchouli distinctive luckily simply state obvious patchouli nobile patchouli scent good place begin know deep highly recognizable note question good patchouli scent happily answer yes fact not good patchouli scent great one seduce without resort brute force caress ambertinge sweetness nestles loamy richness clean earth smooth wood retain dry freshness opening incense pepper elegantly refined devastatingly sexy patchouli absolutely present not overpower layer sandalwood oak moss amber tonka add luxurious velvety quality make superbly wearable go without say already fan patchouli need try feel cozy alluring scent potential win new convert patchouli cult well outstanding
estroverso eau de parfum,Nobile 1942," A sparkling burst of lemon, orange and tangerine gives this lively scent an opening as dazzling as the sun bursting through clouds. Estroverso is a combination of estro  the Italian word of inspiration and intuition  and verso (against)  -- and it is meant to convey that drive to follow inspiration against all odds. It is the passion of invention and creation, and that stubborn streak that compels you to pursue your dreams even when things look hopeless. The vivid citrus and herbs dance over a complex mÃ©lange of vetiver, ambergris, cedar and musk. This has the classic eau de cologne structure, but  heightened. The citrus is extra bright and the base is rich and complex. And there is a little bit of something edgy in there; we are assuming it's the mugwort, because it is what we would imagine a plant with startling healing properties and possible magical applications would smell like  green and potent. Overall, a scintillating potion that will keep you upbeat and alert while waiting for inspiration to strike."," Lemon, Orange, Tangerine, Lime, Rosemary, Mugwort, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Patchouly, Musk, Ambergris",sparkle burst lemon orange tangerine give lively scent opening dazzle sun burst cloud estroverso combination estro italian word inspiration intuition verso mean convey drive follow inspiration odd passion invention creation stubborn streak compel pursue dream even thing look hopeless vivid citrus herbs dance complex malange vetiver ambergris cedar musk classic eau de cologne structure heighten citrus extra bright base rich complex little bit something edgy assume mugwort would imagine plant startling healing property possible magical application would smell like green potent overall scintillate potion keep upbeat alert wait inspiration strike
ambra nobile eau de parfum,Nobile 1942," A classic amber scent, impeccably done. Warm, powdery and  soothing. A fresh citrus and orange blossom opening leads us to the heart of ambergris, labdanum and patchouli. There is a startling hint of salt and stone in the transition and, though we quickly move past that into a smooth and comforting blend of tonka bean, vetiver, cedar and sandalwood, there is something intriguingly solid and cool beneath all the warm elements. This is a fragrance with presence: It has a soft, satisfying sweetness, but it's not candied or syrupy. It's calming, but it feels much too sophisticated to describe it as cozy. The word that leaps to mind is regal. It feels as if this was created for the exclusive use of nobility and we managed to sneak a bottle out of the palace for ourselves. Don't we all deserve to be treated like royalty sometimes?

We can't get enough of the honeyed piquancy of the perfume, with its juicy mandarin and its seductive jasmine; the base of sandalwood, vanilla and smoky, sweet tobacco, rum and cognac is sinfully delicious. Micallef celebrates the fragranceNote VanillÃ©e in its new Art Collection, exclusively available at Luckyscent.

eau divine eau de parfum,Divine," The ninth fragrance by Divine sees this estimable house introduce its first unisex eau de parfum.

il vs iris eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," Il Vs Iris, Hilde Soliani's ode to the precious flower, might be the most charming take on iris. The most surprising too, because the soft, child-like initial impression of the scent fools the wearer into believing that it is a simple, uncomplicated blend. .But wait for the fresh, gently rooty floral top notes to subside, and you will be startled by the beautiful dry greenness of the next accord, woody and verdant, a peppery smell of young leaves and twigs. Wait a little longer, and you will see why we believe that this enchanting composition would delight not only lovers of iris, but also fans of almond and heliotrope. The honeyed nuttiness of almond is not too sweet, just enough to make the perfume downy and soft, fluffy, innocent and unexpectedly sensual.

acquiiissssima eau de parfum,Hilde Soliani," With Acquiilssssima, Hilde Soliani translates haute cuisine into haute parfumerie. Inspired by a dish created by an Italian chef, the scent blends the salty, mineral, fresh aroma of the sea with green tea and jasmine. Those wary of aquatic scents need not be afraid. The saline, subtly, strangely animalic, seaweedy-green smell of the sea is unmistakable here, but it does not lend the composition that aggressively fresh quality so typical of marine fragrances. The pairing of this verdant saltiness and sweet jasmine petals is unexpected, striking and truly sublime. The watery and the floral aspects of the blend are tied together with a green tea note, which possesses qualities of the both, and which lends Acquiilssssima delicate its translucency and a calm, airy feel.

ambra eau de parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," An elegant and dry amber with a sparkling citrus opening. Despite the presence of heavy-hitter base notes like opoponax and patchouli, Ambra feels sheer and refined. The sweetness of the amber and vanilla is balanced with the sharp pepperiness of lavender and a cool, meditative blend of incense notes. This is an amber that is spare, rather than opulent, with a brisk spiciness that complements the sensuous warmth and makes this versatile and easy to wear. If you have been looking for an amber that is wearable day or night and that works in warm weather as well as cool, this is the one. It still has that golden, hypnotic quality that makes amber so addictive, but it is dry and subtle enough to work as an everyday fragrance."," Orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber",elegant dry amber sparkle citrus opening despite presence heavyhitter base note like opoponax patchouli ambra feel sheer refined sweetness amber vanilla balance sharp pepperiness lavender cool meditative blend incense note amber spare rather opulent brisk spiciness complement sensuous warmth make versatile easy wear look amber wearable day night work warm weather well cool one still golden hypnotic quality make amber addictive dry subtle enough work everyday fragrance

It is a giant vat of golden, buttery caramel goodness ready for you to dip yourself in like a carnival apple. Rich vanilla and creamy coconut give this a hint of Mounds bar yumminess (without the chocolate), and a whipped cream smoothness comes from the soft musk and gentle flowers. But mostly, there is caramel  absolutely decadent and sticky-toffee sweet, comforting and enveloping and warm. This is the gooey center of a delicious candy molten sugar and cream cooked oh-so-slowly until it magically transforms. We've rarely encountered a scent that captured the lusciousness of caramel so well . As you know, many of the sugar-laced scents and lotions in the mass market veer into the bitter, plasticky realm as they wear on the skin but this one miraculously does not.

onice eau de parfum ...,Omnia Profumo," Not every fragrance can be described in a line or two  some take a winding path to get to their destination. Onice is one of those fragrances. It opens with a fresh, green, vegetal note. We smell celery, which isn't listed in the notes. Then we get the beginnings of a dense and complicated sweetness that reminds us of immortelle, which is also not listed in the notes. Just when we are about to ignore the notes altogether we get a definite dollop of licorice and a delightfully sweet pineapple  both listed and both very present as they waltz with a variety of partners. Delicate hyacinth, sharp mint, earthy cedar, a dusting of nutmeg. It's an enchanting and unusual journey, that appears to lead to different places for different people on some Onice is sweet and fruity, on others the green and wood notes dominate. The consensus is that it is light and fresh without being aquatic or soapy or citrus and that it is very hard to pin down exactly what it smells like, although we all agree that it smells quite good.

A hint of citrus leads to a delectable fruitiness and then it is full-on vanilla in all its luscious, craving-inducing glory. There are a lot of vanilla scented things in the world, but as any passionate vanilla fan will tell you, they are not all created equal. Quality matters, and a finely crafted vanilla scent is as different from the plasticky, mass-marketed versions as leather is from vinyl. It is no surprise that Farmacia SS Annunziata has given us a superlative version that is tantalizingly edible and utterly seductive. Floral grace notes and velvety amber add warmth and complexity, but they are in the mix as supporting players  dreamy, delicious vanilla is the star attraction here, and she deserves her spotlight.

reve en cuir eau de parfum,Indult," Reve en Cuir was created by Francis Kurkdjian, the perfumer whose talent and work we admire, as an Indult for Scent Bar fragrance. Knowing our love for leather, you will not be surprised to learn that this Luckyscent exclusive is built on the rich leather accord. The traditional citrusy top notes are given a modern twist by the inclusion of spices, cardamom and cloves, and oregano. Instead of being typically fresh, bergamot and lemon in Reve en Cuir have a delicately candied quality and set the tone of the composition with a rich, indolent feel. Cedar and patchouli enhance the smoky character of the leather while never allowing it to become tarry. Oakmoss and vetiver lend the scent that elegantly earthy character that we adore in classical masculine perfumes, while vanilla compliments the citrusy-spicy side of the blend, softening the sharp angles and making Reve en Cuir indeed dreamy and sensual. Spicy, smoky leather with a dangerously appealing soft side  we fall for that every time. Reve en Cuir was conceived as a masculine creation, but as every woman who has ever borrowed her boyfriend's leather jacket knows  some rules are made to be broken."," Bergamot, Lemon, Cardamom, Oregano, Clove Bud, Texan Cedarwood, Patchouli, Oak Moss, Haitian Vetyver, Crystallized Vanilla Recent Press New York Times' Chandler Burr gives Reve en Cuir  Five Stars'Leather  old, dark, smoky, heavy  is diabolically difficult to adapt to an accessible 21st-century format. Under the creative direction of Maselli, Wright and Eastwood, Kurkdjian has succeeded masterfully. RÃªve is a delectable, edible, light-infused leather that is instantly legible, deliciously impossible, as if an HermÃ¨s belt had been candied and baked by a patissier.

Head note: Indonesian patchouli, Heart note: Indonesian patchouli, Base note: Indonesian patchouli. But we stopped giggling and started swooning when we sniffed the actual fragrance, because yes  there is that much patchouli in it, and wow--it is absolutely gorgeous.

The opening spins candy floss, orange and a soft, powdery rose into a shimmering gossamer strand that wraps around the sweet almond note that takes center stage.

takis eau de parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Streamlined and modern.  Dazzlingly sharp lemon and peppery sage set the stage with a brisk, take-no-prisoners policy, and a clean musk and straightforward rose sweep through with equal efficiency. But when a majestic blend of velvety vanilla, exotic ylang ylang and mellow aged oak rolls in, everything slows down and brisk, angular edges are transformed into the smooth, burnished lines of a contemporary sculpture.  Rounded and warm, with a sweet soapiness that is at once familiar and brand new -- like a new, improved soapiness that is a little bit spicier, a little bit creamier, a little bit more of everything we like about soap.

royal muska eau de parfum,M. Micallef," Just like in Baudelaire's poem, the sensual aroma of musk in Micallef's Royal Muska,sings, transporting the soul and sense. Infused with the creamy sensuality of the indolent flowers of ylang ylang and with the honeyed opulence of roses, the fragrance is exotic and infinitely feminine.

vanille oud eau de parfum,M. Micallef," As far as we are concerned, there can't be too many great vanilla scents and there certainly can't be too many aouds. Combine the two, and we are smitten. We are addicted to this unique combo of creamy, dreamy vanilla and spicy, resinous aoud. It is a perfect yin and yang harmony. The caramel-like sweetness of vanilla mixed with ylang-ylang and prune softens the starkness of aoud. Oud, in turn, prevents the vanilla accord from being too predictably foodie and infantile. This is a vanilla fragrance for those who usually shy away from vanillas... and a perfect starter scent for those curious about ouds."," bergamot, ylang-ylang, prune, oud, caramel, musk, vanilla, benzoin",far concerned not many great vanilla scent certainly not many aouds combine two smitten addict unique combo creamy dreamy vanilla spicy resinous aoud perfect yin yang harmony caramellike sweetness vanilla mixed ylangylang prune softens starkness aoud oud turn prevent vanilla accord predictably foodie infantile vanilla fragrance usually shy away vanilla perfect starter scent curious ouds

homme (aoud) eau de parfum,M. Micallef," Micallef's spicy, honeyed rendition of precious aoud, with its mix of golden saffron and dark-red roses, is sensual and wonderfully exotic. The dry smokiness of the fragrance makes us think of the ritual in Arabia, in which women stand over an oud burner, perfuming their skin and clothes with the unique, enthralling fragrance. Balmily sweet and spicily bitter, Micallef's Aoud is a complex, endlessly intriguing scent. It is said that sandalwood is the fragrance for novices, while aoud is for thosein the know.

avant garde eau de parfum,M. Micallef," The new masculine offering from Martine Micallef delivers the great promise of its name. The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible. The base of tonka bean and amber finishes the development on a softer and wonderfully sensual note.

manakara eau de parfum,Indult," The second we smelled this, we were positively overcome by its exotic yet approachable beauty. Named for a village in Madagascar known for its legendary lychee fruit (also spelled litchi), it's presented here as a sweet, honeyed and mysterious floral-tinged pudding-like fruit fragrance with amazing hidden depths -- not purple berry fruit, not bright citrus fruit, but rich and delicate lychee, a scent that's like tropical fruits meets ripe red fruits with a soft, creamy floral mixed in. We've never smelled anything quite like it --  ever -- and we had gourmand lovers, fruity fans, floral worshippers and even deep, dangerous fragrance lovers sampling this and positively banging their wrists on the counter demanding to buy it...and we didn't even carry it yet.  A custardy, creamy sweet fruit dessert of a perfume laced with rose water, we can't compare it to anything you've ever tried before and we're quite certain you'll be utterly smitten by this rare beauty.

isvaraya eau de parfum,Indult," In India, patchouli is associated with Vishnu, the god savior of mankind and life and the guardian of universal harmony.  Isvaraya meansdivine in Hindi and this perfume is the olfactory fantasy of both modern India and spiritual India, an exotic elixir that blends light patchouli with smooth Indian plum tree and wraps it in jasmine. Although it centers on patchouli, it's not overly earthy. It's rich and unusual, slightly sweet and a tad smoky, a fevered evening spent on multi-hued silken sheets while wisps of incense burn sensually in the corners of your mind. The beautiful starkness of jasmine lights the darkness of patchouli and the deep, spiced fruitiness of the plum tree... utterly unique and completely exotic, Isvaraya is not a fluffy little fragrance you wear without thinking. When you smell Isvaraya, you close your eyes and dream and your spirit is at peace."," Patchouli, Indian plum tree, jasmine",india patchouli associated vishnu god savior mankind life guardian universal harmony isvaraya meansdivine hindi perfume olfactory fantasy modern india spiritual india exotic elixir blend light patchouli smooth indian plum tree wraps jasmine although center patchouli not overly earthy rich unusual slightly sweet tad smoky fevere evening spend multihue silken sheet wisps incense burn sensually corner mind beautiful starkness jasmine light darkness patchouli deep spice fruitiness plum tree utterly unique completely exotic isvaraya not fluffy little fragrance wear without think smell isvaraya close eye dream spirit peace
l'inspiratrice eau de parfum,Divine," L'Inspiratrice, the new offering from the very elegant Divine collection of scents, is a supremely sensual fragrance that displays the refined, classic quality, which we consider to be Divine's trademark in perfume. The dark-red, honeyed warmth of the roses, enhanced by the sweet creaminess of ylang-ylang, vanilla and tonka bean, is combined with the dry and at the same time almost-gourmand earthiness of patchouli and the greenness of vetiver. A delicate sparkle, added to the composition by bergamot and peony, is utterly charming. L'Inspiratrice is bound to please even the most sophisticated of seductresses. Very chic.

all that matters eau de parfum,Anamor," A subtle and elegant skin scent.  Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive  therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling. Discreetly seductive."," musk, sandalwood, lily of the valley",subtle elegant skin scent deceptively simple composition matter one fragrance merge skin reads like aura perfume simplicity work quality ingredient musk lover tell not musk create equal musk heart matter smooth silken lightness almost airy particular musk also rare prohibitively expensive therefore infrequently use commercial fragrance except tiny amount handcraft blend however star player pair gorgeous compelling sandalwood oil east india delicate crispness lily valley quiet compelling discreetly seductive

divine eau de parfum,Divine," When we heard there was a cult fragrance named Divine, we had our doubts.  It might be very nice, maybe even lovely, but seriously... divine?  That's a bit presumptuous, isn't it?  Then we tried it and all skepticism vanished.  Divine is indeed divine.  We can't think of a better way to describe it.  The first whiff is very strong, very French, very opera and pearls.  Classic and rather formal. As it warms up, it becomes downright swanky-- still sophisticated, but drenched in the glamour of a bygone era:  Black Givenchy dresses, long cigarette holders and serious diamonds. Sipping ice-cold martinis with Frank and Dino on a red leather banquette at the Sands.  And just then, best of all, there is the amazing and complex drydown, balancing soft peach and superbly fresh flowers with a deep base of oak moss, vanilla, musk and spice. Achingly beautiful, impossible to forget. Not a scent for those who prefer their scents girlish and sugary or simple and unobtrusive. This is for confident, complicated women who are prepared to dazzle. Stunning. Breathtaking.

eau capitale eau de parfum,Diptyque," When a brand as synonymous with niche fragrance as Diptyque decides to create a scent celebrating the city of Paris,  the possibilities are almost overwhelming. What kind of scent could possibly capture the entirety of the rich,  multi-textured relationship between The City of Lights and the house of Diptyque? But of course,  there actually is a perfect answer- the chypre,  iconic amongst perfume styles,  a legendary accord with a thousand facets. But with the classic chypre so instantly identifiable- bergamot,  rose,  jasmine,  patchouli,  oakmoss- it's incumbent on any re-interpretation to bring something new and unique to the proceedings. Thus,  Eau Capitale is a chypre both respectful of tradition,  and yet uniquely and romantically modern- a dynamic new study of balance and contrast featuring a fresh yet timeless take on the beloved style. It still boats a lively citrus opening,  but with a twist- an especially green ""vert de bergamote"" of pronounced energy,  paired with a burst of pink peppercorn,  unique to the chypre style,  which gives a cool,  sparkling opening of notable modernity. The heart has a classic rose presence,  but utilizing three distinctive expressions of Damascene rose: an essence,  an absolute,  and a concentrate,  for a truly multifaceted and complex floral experience.

chypre azural eau de parfum,Les Indemodables," If you've long thought of the chypre category as dark and mysterious, think again. Chypre Azural is as juicy and fresh as the Sicilian Tarocco orange at its heart. Typically a contrast between fresh top notes and a mossy accord, that characteristic contrast can go in many directions, and in Chypre Azural it tips toward aromatic and bright, with patchouli grounding it in that family.An intriguing tarragon note snakes its aromatic way around a subdued rose and prominent orange, drying down to a skin scent with substance thanks to an authentic ambergris tincture, which adds body, roundness, and a touch of shadow to its sunny nature. Unlike many citrus-forward scents that seem to disappear as soon as you spray them on, Chypre Azural sticks around, swirling and evolving on skin until it and you become one."," Sicilian Tarocco orange oil, Egyptian centifolia rose absolute grand cru, Indonesian patchouli, Ambergris tincture, Tarragon from the Alps",long think chypre category dark mysterious think chypre azural juicy fresh sicilian tarocco orange heart typically contrast fresh top note mossy accord characteristic contrast go many direction chypre azural tip toward aromatic bright patchouli ground family intriguing tarragon note snake aromatic way around subdue rise prominent orange drying skin scent substance thanks authentic ambergris tincture add body roundness touch shadow sunny nature unlike many citrusforward scent seem disappear soon spray chypre azural stick around swirl evolve skin become one
l'eau des sacres,Reims Parfums," L'Eau des Sacres executes its leap between its cool-toned, aromatic opening and its warm, golden drydown so effortlessly that it feels like watching the prima ballerina at the Paris Opera performing a piquÃ© turn for you alone. Opening in a cloud of peppery violet-and-lavender brightness, the scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious, like wandering into a small, rustic French church at Easter and inhaling the scent of flowers and herbs being placed over nubbins of waxy, lemony frankincense. Wafts of honeyed orange blossom add to the spring-like delicacy and brightness.It's in the basenotes that things take a seriously sensual tone. Dropping the aromatic herbs and petals of its opening, the scent dips us backwards into a warm bath of buttery, almond-inflected tonka bean, bolstered with a gorgeous buerre noisette' sandalwood. Lovers of Tonka ImpÃ©riale will rejoice in this drydown  similarly warm and comforting as the Guerlain, L'Eau des Sacres is perhaps even more natural-smelling and durable. A touch of ambergris adds an agreeably salty-fresh bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. We think that that L'Eau des Sacres' a little from column A, a little from column B' approach creates the perfect all-season bridge between the freshness of aromatic spring florals and the buttery winter weight of tonka-fied amber."," Pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris",leau des sacre executes leap cooltone aromatic opening warm golden drydown effortlessly feel like watch prima ballerina paris opera perform piqua turn alone opening cloud peppery violetandlavender brightness scent feel ethereal yet unpretentious like wander small rustic french church easter inhale scent flower herbs place nubbins waxy lemony frankincense wafts honey orange blossom add springlike delicacy brightness basenote thing take seriously sensual tone drop aromatic herbs petal opening scent dip us backwards warm bath buttery almondinflected tonka bean bolster gorgeous buerre noisette sandalwood lover tonka impariale rejoice drydown similarly warm comfort guerlain leau des sacre perhaps even naturalsmelle durable touch ambergris add agreeably saltyfresh bitterness keep sweetness check think leau des sacre little column little column b approach create perfect allseason bridge freshness aromatic spring floral buttery winter weight tonkafie amber
awake eau de parfum,Akro," The opening jolts you awake, like a loved one passing a freshly brewed espresso in front of your nose as you begin to nod off. Hot, black, intense roasted bean with the burnt edge of wood crackling in the grate. The green bite of cardamom giving it a tart edge. Awake's darkness is tantalizingly profound, but the perfumer has thoughtfully slipped a nugget of toasted hazelnut in with the coffee to buffer it from any sharpness or acridity. Awake manages that compromise between sharp and sweet so smoothly that you begin to imagine it's easy  but make no mistake, it is the experienced hand of Cresp that keeps the scent on an even keel. The dance of coffee, hazelnut, and toasted wood ebbs and flows through the scent like a steady pulse, before sweetening slightly, finishing out in a remarkably textured rendition of those crunchy coffee candies in the checkout aisle of Italian grocery stores. Not sweet, not particularly gourmand, and yet, also not bitter or grainy in that way that coffee scents can be, Awake is the happy medium of coffee scents."," Balkans Santos Coffee, Green Cardamom, Italian Lemon, Haitian Vetiver",opening jolt awake like love one pass freshly brew espresso front nose begin nod hot black intense roast bean burn edge wood crackle grate green bite cardamom give tart edge awake darkness tantalizingly profound perfumer thoughtfully slip nugget toast hazelnut coffee buffer sharpness acridity awake manage compromise sharp sweet smoothly begin imagine easy make no mistake experienced hand cresp keep scent even keel dance coffee hazelnut toast wood ebb flows scent like steady pulse sweeten slightly finish remarkably texture rendition crunchy coffee candy checkout aisle italian grocery store not sweet not particularly gourmand yet also not bitter grainy way coffee scent awake happy medium coffee scent

One is a couturier, the other a perfumer. Their childhood memories brought them together. Remembering captivating smells; of the leather from an elegant attachÃ© case or an immaculate desk blotter; of the distinct smells of wood during the regular gathering of fuel to warm the family home.

fille en aiguilles eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," The name meansGirls in Needles  and pine needles at that, rather than chictalons aiguilles (stiletto heels)... But boys can roll around in them too: this is a decidedly non-gendered, atmospheric scent.Pine essence is a risky bet in perfumery: its medicinal, turpentine fumes conjure household disinfectants or cough drops and are particularly hard to tame. Serge Lutens, never one to shirk a challenge, opted for playing them up rather than tamping them down: the result is uncharacteristically raw, almost minimalist. In Filles en Aiguilles, the powerful resinous smell of pine is compounded by the camphor blast of vetiver and a wisp of gunpowder incense. Fruity fir balsam and the trademark Lutens candied fruit notes sweeten the blend without playing down its dark green radiance. A searing afternoon in Mediterranean pine groves or a Californian forest; a Buddhist temple or Christmas morning; the hale aroma of a lumber yard; a painter's studio strewn with turpentine-soaked rags...  Whatever memories Filles en Aiguilles conjures, this poignantly evocative, meditative potion will somehow feel healing. You'll need it this winter.

purple haze eau de parfum,19-69," ""The fragrance Purple Haze embraces the hippie movement and counterculture just like John and Yoko's bed-ins in Amsterdam and Montreal. Purple Haze is about the legendary Keenak who I met in Bahama Village, Key West. Guitar on his back, snakeskin boots, skinny jeans, and long hair. A sense of Woodstock.

over the chocolate shop eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Once upon a time, 4160 Tuesdays magic-maker Sarah McCartney was inspired to create a chocolate scent by her friend's apartment, which was serendipitously perched atop a chocolate shop. The scent was everything a chocolate shop scent should be- rich, creamy, and delectable- but this was before Sarah had learned the ins and outs of perfume production, so the recipe went back in a drawer. Years later, it has been resurrected, and we're all the richer for it. Simply put, if you've been searching for the scent of real chocolate- not cookies, not cake, but a pure, decadent chocolate truffle- Over the Chocolate Shop may just be your holy grail.

eleventh hour eau de parfum,BYREDO," It seems funny to say this, but Eleventh Hour is not the first fragrance we've carried based on the end of the world. It is, however, still quite a novelty- the first fragrance ever to feature an astonishing new note- Ban Timmur, a Nepalese plant related to Szechwan pepper, known for both intense, almost anesthetic spice but also unusually bright, citrussy tones. Don't worry if it's hard to imagine- the utterly unique note is the very first thing you'll smell on your initial spray, a combination of juicy citrus and sweet, spicy, clovelike tones for a note both thrillingly novel, but also possessed of a certain familiar holiday-spice styled comfort. The heart it leads into is every bit as original- spicy, earthy carrot seed set against sweetly seductive rum and juicy, wild fig. Warm, smooth tonka dominates the drydown, but the real wonder of 11th Hour is the pervasiveness of the Ban Timmur, lending the fragrance the sweet, rich spiciness of an opulent oriental scent, but with a distinctively fresh energy that lasts into the drydown. According to Byredo, featuring an ingredient from the imposing Nepalese highlands is a statement on the kind of inhospitable places humanity may eventually be forced to survive as ocean levels rise. Heavier stuff than a perfume description can necessarily grapple with, to be sure, but at least now we know that when the end of the world arrives, we're going to be smelling great, really, really, great."," Ban timmur pepper, bergamot, carrot seed, rum, wild fig, tonka bean, cashmere woods",seem funny say eleventh hour not first fragrance carry base end world however still quite novelty first fragrance ever feature astonishing new note ban timmur nepalese plant relate szechwan pepper know intense almost anesthetic spice also unusually bright citrussy tone not worry hard imagine utterly unique note first thing smell initial spray combination juicy citrus sweet spicy clovelike tone note thrillingly novel also possess certain familiar holidayspice style comfort heart lead every bit original spicy earthy carrot seed set sweetly seductive rum juicy wild fig warm smooth tonka dominate drydown real wonder 11th hour pervasiveness ban timmur lending fragrance sweet rich spiciness opulent oriental scent distinctively fresh energy last drydown accord byredo feature ingredient impose nepalese highland statement kind inhospitable place humanity may eventually force survive ocean level rise heavier stuff perfume description necessarily grapple sure least know end world arrive go smell great really really great
sabbia bianca eau de parfum,Profumum," Concentrated at a whopping 43% of pure perfume oil and playing host to some of the world's most exquisite natural floral absolutes, Sabbia Bianca is the Rolls Royce of the Big White Floral genre. The composition is uncluttered, with only four listed notes. That's because when you go to the trouble of sourcing the best and most expensive tuberose, ylang, and tiare, you want their beauty to be able to shine uninterrupted. Sabbia Bianca is the perfect fantasy of a tropical island in a bottle, complete with sugar-white sand, crystalline azure waters, and gently-swaying palm trees. Immediately upon application, you are plunged into a pool of lush, inviting coconut milk, its surface dotted with waxy tiare petals. The buttery tuberose and gardenia are huge, and so heavily narcotic that you feel as if you've sipped on moonshine made from tropical flowers. Although Sabbia Bianca is almost obscenely rich, flickers of a woody freshness here and there hold the perfume back from excessive sweetness - perhaps the banana leaf nuance in the ylang or the greenness of the violet. That said, keep in mind that just one drop of this super concentrated elixir is enough to radiate heady tropical warmth all day long. Our take on Sabbia Bianca is this: sometimes you have to go all out to experience perfection in a genre. And for us, Sabbia Bianca is worth the investment."," tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, tiare",concentrated whopping 43 pure perfume oil play host world exquisite natural floral absolute sabbia bianca roll royce big white floral genre composition uncluttered four list note go trouble source good expensive tuberose ylang tiare want beauty able shine uninterrupted sabbia bianca perfect fantasy tropical island bottle complete sugarwhite sand crystalline azure water gentlyswaye palm tree immediately upon application plunge pool lush invite coconut milk surface dotted waxy tiare petal buttery tuberose gardenia huge heavily narcotic feel sip moonshine make tropical flower although sabbia bianca almost obscenely rich flicker woody freshness hold perfume back excessive sweetness perhaps banana leaf nuance ylang greenness violet say keep mind one drop super concentrated elixir enough radiate heady tropical warmth day long take sabbia bianca sometimes go experience perfection genre us sabbia bianca worth investment

the time eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," What a beautiful, refreshing tea scent! Fans of tea scents know that a good one is difficult to find; well, House of Oud's The Time is a good one. The opening of bergamot, chamomile, and wormwood note creates a superb green tea impression, uniquely fresh and bitter, but with a nutty hay-like undertone. Slowly, other types of tea notes start to feed into the scent, helping to round out the picture and fill in the gaps. Oolong tea adds a milkiness that softens the astringency of the green tea, rendering it cloudy, while a black tea note lends a smoky leathery nuance. Together, the combination of the different teas gives the scent a subtleroasted undertone.   There's a series of contrasts at play here that works very well. The Time smells both fresh and comforting, milky and smoky, which all adds up to a sort of green-on-cream effect. The nubuck suede notes in the base tie it all together for an experience that feels like drinking a cup of green tea in an upmarket equestrian store, surrounded by the complex aromas of saddle leather, tea leaves, and even the polite suggestion of hay. We're confident that fans of refined leather-tea fragrances such as Memo's Eau de Memo and Hermes' Osmanthe Yunnan will find a new love in The Time."," Bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea",beautiful refreshing tea scent fan tea scent know good one difficult find well house ouds time good one opening bergamot chamomile wormwood note create superb green tea impression uniquely fresh bitter nutty haylike undertone slowly type tea note start feed scent help round picture fill gaps oolong tea add milkiness softens astringency green tea rendering cloudy black tea note lend smoky leathery nuance together combination different teas give scent subtleroasted undertone series contrast play work well time smell fresh comfort milky smoky add sort greenoncream effect nubuck suede note base tie together experience feel like drinking cup green tea upmarket equestrian store surround complex aromas saddle leather tea leave even polite suggestion hay confident fan refined leathertea fragrance memos eau de memo hermes osmanthe yunnan find new love time

freeway eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Freeway is the story that jumped, fully formed, into Sarah McCartney's mind when she visited Scent Bar one hot summer's day and stepped out onto the hot asphalt outside. A friend was just driving away, and the smell of his Maserati's exhaust mixed with the scent of the orange blossom in the air and the tang of hot, melting asphalt...Sarah was inspired then and there to create an urban take on orange blossom exclusively for Luckyscent, to help celebrate our 15th anniversary. The idea was to take the fresh, sugary brightness of orange blossom and sully it with a host of gritty, determinedly non-floral smells from an urban environment, making for a scent with a sexy kick in its tail: think flowers crushed under a rubber-soled sneaker. Sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil here for its plummy citrus aroma but also for its fuel-like facet; the result is sweet orange blossom water spilled on hot tar. For such a popular note, orange blossom is easy to get wrong  too sweet and it's juvenile, too honeyed and it can turn sleazy. Freeway does orange blossom right, pitched exactly halfway between bright and dark. Dry woods, tobacco, and grassy cannabis notes dry out the tarry orange blossom until it smells more like old paper and less like a flower. A light, foamy vanilla froths around the dry, papery notes for a result that smells like eating a thimbleful of insanely rich, perfumery orange blossom gelato in an antique book store. Urban and urbane, Freeway is the scent of L.A.'s future, when, as Sarah says,all cars are solar powered and the Freeways have cycle lanes, orange groves, jasmine hedgerows, and picnic areas."," Mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla",freeway story jump fully form sarah mccartney mind visit scent bar one hot summer day step onto hot asphalt outside friend drive away smell maseratis exhaust mixed scent orange blossom air tang hot melt asphaltsarah inspire create urban take orange blossom exclusively luckyscent help celebrate 15th anniversary idea take fresh sugary brightness orange blossom sully host gritty determinedly nonfloral smell urban environment make scent sexy kick tail think flower crush rubbersole sneaker sarah use mandarin petigrain oil plummy citrus aroma also fuellike facet result sweet orange blossom water spill hot tar popular note orange blossom easy get wrong sweet juvenile honey turn sleazy freeway orange blossom right pitch exactly halfway bright dark dry wood tobacco grassy cannabis note dry tarry orange blossom smell like old paper less like flower light foamy vanilla froth around dry papery note result smell like eat thimbleful insanely rich perfumery orange blossom gelato antique book store urban urbane freeway scent las future sarah saysall car solar power freeway cycle lanes orange grove jasmine hedgerows picnic area
20 mars 2022 eau de parfum,Rundholz Parfums," What does the future smell like? Obviously, we'll have to wait to know for sure, but with 20MARS2022, Rundholz for the first time explores the scent of a date not yet reached- and they're reaching for the stars. Opening with an intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed with a bouquet of refined gourmand spice, delicately sweetened with a touch of fruit and a rich, but restrained floral heart. The true star, as with all Rundholz scents, is the deep, balsamic incense that emerges in the heart, rich and resinous, made lightly smoky with a touch of crÃ¨me brulee vanilla and haylike Tonka bean, given a sensual animalic growl with civet and castoreum.  Overall, the effect is enveloping, the kind of deep, wondrous incense scent where each sniff reveals a new facet. Sure, we know the ""Mars"" in 20Mars2022 refers to the month, and not the planet. But with a scent this out of this world, you'll have to forgive us for not always remembering that."," Pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, Tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum",future smell like obviously wait know sure 20mars2022 rundholz first time explore scent date not yet reach reach star opening intensely peppery explosion quickly warm bouquet refined gourmand spice delicately sweeten touch fruit rich restrain floral heart true star rundholz scent deep balsamic incense emerge heart rich resinous make lightly smoky touch cra brulee vanilla haylike tonka bean give sensual animalic growl civet castoreum overall effect envelop kind deep wondrous incense scent sniff reveal new facet sure know mars 20mars2022 refer month not planet scent world forgive us not always remember
une amourette roland mouret eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," ""An unforgettable love affair, "" Une Amourette is the result of a portentious conversation between Etat Libre d'Orange and groundbreaking fashion designer Roland Mouret. Every bit as iconoclastic in the world of design as ELDO is for French fragrance,  Mouret's work demonstrate a preternatural eye for sensuality,  flow and innovation,  a gift for draping fabric over skin in the same way that Etienne de Swardt's fragrances drape the skin. So,  of course,  a collaboration was inevitable- but what a collaboration this is. Soft and romantic,  yet striking and avant-garde,  Une Amourette is a beautifully woodsy iris that wears like the most flattering couture you can imagine. It starts with the iris note- sharp but not stark,  with just the right amount of floral lushness to allow the vanilla-tinged akigala wood to slowly develop underneath,  adding a purringly seductive,  subtly muscular form to the flowing silhouette of the scent. As it dries,  the gentle earthiness of the iris further gives shape to the body beneath,  evoking a softer-but still distinctive- carnality that has us positively swooning. Some partnerships are so obvious you wonder why they've taken so long to manifest,  but in the case of Une Amourette,  we think we know the answer- they wanted to keep us waiting."," Iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine",unforgettable love affair une amourette result portentious conversation etat libre dorange groundbreake fashion designer roland mouret every bit iconoclastic world design eldo french fragrance mouret work demonstrate preternatural eye sensuality flow innovation gift drape fabric skin way etienne de swardts fragrance drape skin course collaboration inevitable collaboration soft romantic yet strike avantgarde une amourette beautifully woodsy iris wear like flattering couture imagine start iris note sharp not stark right amount floral lushness allow vanillatinge akigala wood slowly develop underneath add purringly seductive subtly muscular form flow silhouette scent dry gentle earthiness iris give shape body beneath evoke softerbut still distinctive carnality us positively swoon partnership obvious wonder take long manif case une amourette think know answer want keep us wait
le cri de la lumiere eau de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Inspired by the light towards which all beings reach out whether entering or leaving this world, Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re employs a sparse framework of just three notes: ambrette, iris, and rose. But for all its elegant minimalism, this is a scent with plenty to say. Ambrette, with its tart nuances of green apple, pear, and grappa, is first to announce its presence, bathing the scent in a halo of crystalline light. The opening pitches high, with an almost citrusy sparkle. The iris note, at first rooty and then bready, moves in to flesh out the structure, like a length of suede draped over a metal chair. Comparisons between this perfume and another ambrette-iris composition, Chanel No. 18, are natural  but Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re is far brighter and drier affair, with a delicate sourness absent from the Chanel. As silvery as a glass of white vermouth, the scent gains a blush in its cheeks thanks to the late addition of rose.

wulong cha extrait de parfum,Nishane," Wulong ChÃ¡ is a vibrant, woody fig tea with a refreshing twist of citrus to give it sparkle. It opens with an Earl Grey type of freshness, with black tea leaves oily with bergamot, orange, and an exotic, fruity lift that is not immediately identifiable (that would be the litchi). But the heart is pure Oolong: a smoky tea full of delicate, nutty roasted flavors, and a slight but noticeable milkiness. The introduction of the fig note in the heart adds to this impression of milkiness; it smells beautifully like a freshly snapped fig leaf, green and oozing with fig sap.What a lovely balance of tannins, fruit, and milk this is. We like Wulong ChÃ¡ because it has both the clean, fresh transparency we've come to expect from great tea fragrances, but also a sweet, figgy milkiness that rounds off any sharp corners. In the later stages, a gauzy white musk, as soft as a pillow and spiced gently with nutmeg, wraps everything up in a light, silky embrace. Wulong ChÃ¡ is a refreshing wear, especially in summer, but it's also insanely soothing. Strictly to be worn with a white linen shirt and a mint julep in hand."," Bergamot, orange, lychee, mandarin, oolong tea, nutmeg, musk, fig",wulong cha vibrant woody fig tea refreshing twist citrus give sparkle open earl grey type freshness black tea leave oily bergamot orange exotic fruity lift not immediately identifiable would litchi heart pure oolong smoky tea full delicate nutty roast flavor slight noticeable milkiness introduction fig note heart add impression milkiness smell beautifully like freshly snap fig leaf green oozing fig sap lovely balance tannins fruit milk like wulong cha clean fresh transparency come expect great tea fragrance also sweet figgy milkiness round sharp corner later stage gauzy white musk soft pillow spice gently nutmeg wraps everything light silky embrace wulong cha refreshing wear especially summer also insanely soothe strictly wear white linen shirt mint julep hand

guimauve de noel eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Selected by Denyse Beaulieu to feature in her top 10 of 2016 for Grain de Musc, Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a pillowy marshmallow scent flavored with orange flower water and dusted in enough powdered sugar to make your teeth ache. But while it reminds us most pleasurably of fougassette, a type of bread fragrant with orange flower water sold in every market in Provence, this is not at all a heavy, gluttonous fragrance. Rather, it is a tender puff of orange flower-scented air with the sparkle of sugar crystals. It has a very French character, reminiscent both of those little chouquettes eaten by French schoolchildren at snack time, as well as the milky vapors of their evening baths, orange flower water sprinkled liberally into the water by Maman. Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a frothy, tender delight that is just perfect for celebrating the innocence of youth and the joy of family life.

baraonda extrait de parfum,Nasomatto," A mysterious addition to the Nasomatto line, Baraonda comes with few clues attached.

The nose of this fragrance warns us that it will evokea raw taste sensation....but what we taste is both comforting and refined. Baraonda smells like the pleasures of fall, painted with a light hand. A tumbler of whiskey held up to catch the glow from an open fire. Delicate little glass bowls holding red berries, quince, and apples baked slowly until they fall apart. An old book, open on the lap, filling the air with the dry, papery scent of lignin. A hint of caramelized wood resin dancing around the edges of the room but never closing in.

Their bergamot and bigarade fruits light up Byredo's Palermo, a scent as close to olfactory happiness as you can get, a perfume played in the highest, brightest keys.Palermo's citrus grove sits alongside a rose garden, its rose bushes greened up in spring with the smell of crushed orange tree leaves and sliced fruits: lemon, lime, grapefruit, and maybe even aromatic pomelo. In its opening, an effervescent freshness of citrus juice is layered with cut citrus rinds, their zest oils conveying a more intense richness, bitterness, and spice.During your walk in the garden, as the sun warms your skin, a warm musk rises up, slightly powdery, softening the bracing freshness of the hesperidic top notes of Palermo and helping the freshness to linger with the warmth.

sorriso eau de parfum,Profumum," A delicious and sophisticated gourmand scent built on the always-enticing combination of chocolate and orange. The bitter orange opening is bright and sharp and does not fade away, but melds beautifully with the intense and luscious chocolate note that dominates the blend.  The notes list bitter chocolate, but it does not have the aggressive bite of unsweetened baker's squares. Instead it reminds us of fine, European bittersweet cocoa powder  like Valrhona or Callebaut  rich and dark, with just a hint of sweetness. Dusted over fresh orange and velvety woods (and perhaps a creamy vanilla-tinged note, as well), this is a luxurious, grown-up cocoa with no marshmallows in sight. Sorriso is one of the most elegant chocolate scents we have ever encountered. It isn't sugary or buttery and it doesn't juxtapose the edible elements with surprising, jarring notes. It is smooth and balanced, earning its sophistication by embracing the bitter elements of chocolate, as well as the sweet, and by using soft, soothing wood as an anchor. Sorriso means smile and this fragrance will surely evoke many of them."," Bitter chocolate, bitter orange, exotic woods",delicious sophisticated gourmand scent build alwaysentice combination chocolate orange bitter orange opening bright sharp not fade away meld beautifully intense luscious chocolate note dominate blend note list bitter chocolate not aggressive bite unsweetened baker square instead remind us fine european bittersweet cocoa powder like valrhona callebaut rich dark hint sweetness dust fresh orange velvety wood perhaps creamy vanillatinge note well luxurious grownup cocoa no marshmallows sight sorriso one elegant chocolate scent ever encounter not sugary buttery not juxtapose edible element surprising jarring note smooth balance earn sophistication embrace bitter element chocolate well sweet use soft soothe wood anchor sorriso mean smile fragrance surely evoke many

korrigan eau de parfum,Lubin," Korrigan is less harmless than it looks. This caramel wood is no perfume from childhood; it is a scent of intimacy, insidiously musky and irresistible on the skin of a desired being. It is the fragrance of the senses set free, to be shared or saved for intimate moments, when caresses follow on sweet whispers and bodies draw closer. It is an invitation to voluptuousness, to sensuous pleasures, and to fantasies of the most extravagant kind.Perfumer Thomas Fontaine first of all imagined a tree for Lubin, to be calledCaramel Wood. Its sap would be sweet like English toffee, but with tangy accents of wild apple, juniper and saffron, to answer for some of its mystery. He wanted a note of leather yet appetising, smooth like a whisky cream liqueur, yet smoky, fragrant and slightly bitter like superb pure malt."," Juniper berry, saffron, cognac, Lavender, ambrette, whiskey, Cedar, oudh, leather, vetiver, musk",korrigan less harmless look caramel wood no perfume childhood scent intimacy insidiously musky irresistible skin desire fragrance sense set free share save intimate moment caress follow sweet whisper body draw close invitation voluptuousness sensuous pleasure fantasy extravagant kind perfumer thomas fontaine first imagine tree lubin calledcaramel wood sap would sweet like english toffee tangy accent wild apple juniper saffron answer mystery want note leather yet appetise smooth like whisky cream liqueur yet smoky fragrant slightly bitter like superb pure malt
bois d'ascese eau de parfum,Naomi Goodsir," A meditative swirl of serene incense, intensified by smoked wood. At first, this brings to mind a stark, secluded chapel and a life of plain and simple pleasures. But as it develops, notes of whiskey, tobacco and cinnamon begin to shimmer through the incense, and you start to think that perhaps these pleasures won't be quite so plain, after all. If you have ever enjoyed a fine Islay Scotch whiskey, such as Lagavulin or Laphroaig, you are familiar with the way the intricacies of smoke and moss add a complicated and enigmatic appeal  harsh and medicinal one moment, mesmerizing the next. The layers of smoked cade wood, oakmoss and whiskey have a similar effect here, as bracing jolts of smoke morph into the airy tranquility of incense, keeping us endlessly intrigued and hopelessly addicted.  A starkly elegant fragrance that puts us in a trance.All Naomi Goodsir Parfums include an atomizer spray."," tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, Somalian incense",meditative swirl serene incense intensify smoke wood first bring mind stark seclude chapel life plain simple pleasure develop note whiskey tobacco cinnamon begin shimmer incense start think perhaps pleasure not quite plain ever enjoyed fine islay scotch whiskey lagavulin laphroaig familiar way intricacy smoke moss add complicated enigmatic appeal harsh medicinal one moment mesmerize next layer smoke cade wood oakmoss whiskey similar effect brace jolt smoke morph airy tranquility incense keep us endlessly intrigue hopelessly addict starkly elegant fragrance put us trance naomi goodsir parfum include atomizer spray
philosykos - eau de parfum,Diptyque," One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time, now even stronger and more compelling.  This ode to the fig groves of Greece is still a very green fig  a fig just on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play  sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove  the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens. Many a superlative has been used to describe this fragrance over the years and it deserves every one. Outstanding."," Fig tree leaves, wood, white cedar",one good fig scent ever make one favorite scent time even strong compelling ode fig grove greece still green fig fig verge ripe opening sharp tart freshness leave fig come play sweet enough tantalize not overwhelm glossy green leave succulent fruit intertwine dry wood note hint rich earth get sense not whole tree whole grove wood earth sky mediterranean sun coax sweetness fruit along ripens many superlative use describe fragrance year deserve every one outstanding

tilda swinton like this eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," With Like This, Etat Libre d'Orange pays homage to the intelligent and surreally beautiful actress Tilda Swinton. Etat's challenge was immediate: to create a fragrance that reflects Swinton's uncommon grace and talent. Like Swinton, the fragrance needed to be unusual yet welcoming, delicate yet strong, seductive without being distracting, and full of radiance. With Like This, they succeeded. Like This is unlike any other fragrance we've smelled, and yet it is as comfortable and warm as a summer afternoon in the Scottish hillside.The fragrance opens with a juicy hit of neroli and mandarin, and it is quickly balanced by the earthiness of pumpkin flesh, a note rarely found in perfume. A thread of exotic immortelle and powdered ginger add both sweetness and spice to the composition. But don't think Like This smells like the pantry a lush bouquet of rose, heliotrope, and green vetiver are the foundation on which the scent is built, and a hint of clean musk adds intimacy. Like This wears for hours, yet stays close to the skin. Like This follows Swinton's lead in breaking artistic convention.

nio eau de parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff describes Nio asA refreshing walk through the south Italian countryside,  and they couldn't be more right. Wearing Nio,  we imagine strolling down a shady,  cypress-lined lane in the height of summer,  just before the sun sets. It's that special time between day and night,  the time the French refer to as the blue hour. A slight breeze lifts from a nearby ocean,  cooling the warm air and mingling with the fresh,  herbal scent of the trees and their woody bark. Soon night will fall and the crickets will begin to chirp. We're thinking of the chilled Campari and good company waiting at the villa just ahead. Nio opens with a mouthwatering blend of rich neroli and Calabrian bergamot before deepening into its resinous,  green heart. Hints of spice,  pepper,  and dry cedar enliven the composition,  and vetiver keeps Nio's refreshing fragrance grounded. Unlike many green,  earthy fragrances,  Nio doesn't fade into a vague woody shadow. Instead,  it retains its refined vivaciousness for hours and hours,  alternately showing its uplifting then mysterious aspects. Nio is the rare fragrance that is fresh without being jarring and elegant without being stuffy."," Neroli, Calabrian bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, green leaves, cedar, gaiac wood, Haitian vetiver, Indian patchouli, amber",xerjoff describe nio asa refreshing walk south italian countryside could not right wear nio imagine stroll shady cypressline lane height summer sun set special time day night time french refer blue hour slight breeze lift nearby ocean cool warm air mingle fresh herbal scent tree woody bark soon night fall cricket begin chirp think chill campari good company wait villa ahead nio open mouthwatere blend rich neroli calabrian bergamot deepen resinous green heart hint spice pepper dry cedar enliven composition vetiver keep nio refreshing fragrance ground unlike many green earthy fragrance nio not fade vague woody shadow instead retain refined vivaciousness hour hour alternately show uplifting mysterious aspect nio rare fragrance fresh without jarring elegant without stuffy
jubilation xxv eau de parfum,Amouage," Unabashedly opulent. There is nothing minimal about this celebratory elixir and we couldn't be happier about that. Let's face it, sometimes more is more. Jubilation XXV features the prized frankincense of the Sultanate of Oman, but this is not a meditative, stone cathedral type of incense fragrance. This is a lavish bazaar, packed to the brim with all of the treasures of 1001 nights.  The silver frankincense weaves through burnished woods, luscious fruits and blood-warming spices. It teases the elusive rock rose and the ever-so-grand orchid and wraps itself around luxurious opoponax and amber. The opening is sweet and honeyed, with a hint of bitterness that reminds us of the aftertaste that lets you know when a fruity liqueur is going to pack a wallop. (Fans of Frapin 1270 may want to join us in enjoying this deep and satisfying fruity booziness). As the scent mellows, it becomes richer and the wood notes become prominent. In spite of the litany of intense and dark-sounding notes, this never becomes gothic or moody. The aura is warm and velvety and extremely content, like you are leaning against a great golden lion who is purring like a race car. This is designed for men, yet somewhere deep down inside we know there is no way the women of the world are going to let the guys keep something this fantastic all to themselves."," Frankincense, labdanum ciste, coriander, davana, blackberry, orange, gaicwood, rose, honey, bay, orchid, cinnamon, clove, celery seed, opoponox, patchouli, myrrh, musk, moss, atlas cedarwood, ambergris, oud, immortelle",unabashedly opulent nothing minimal celebratory elixir could not happy let us face sometimes jubilation xxv feature prize frankincense sultanate oman not meditative stone cathedral type incense fragrance lavish bazaar pack brim treasure 1001 night silver frankincense weave burnish wood luscious fruit bloodwarming spice tease elusive rock rise eversogrand orchid wraps around luxurious opoponax amber opening sweet honey hint bitterness remind us aftertaste lets know fruity liqueur go pack wallop fan frapin 1270 may want join us enjoy deep satisfy fruity booziness scent mellow become rich wood note become prominent spite litany intense darksounde note never become gothic moody aura warm velvety extremely content like lean great golden lion purr like race car design man yet somewhere deep inside know no way woman world go let guy keep something fantastic

magenta pop eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," To Prin Lomros, the hopes and fears, triumphs and failures of young love can be represented by a somewhat unlikely avatar: pop rocks. It's not as crazy as it might seem- aside from being a reliable source of childhood nostalgia, the fizzy, exploding candy is just like the experiences that make up the romantic awakening of adolescence: sweet, painful, exciting, unpredictable, and fleeting. This is the concept behind Magenta Pop, a candy-inspired summer scent of sweet, juicy, occasionally painful romance. Magenta Pop is built around grape, but not the fruity dimensionality of a wine or table grape- the flattened purple sweetness of the ubiquitous candy flavor, syrupy and indulgent. Contrast, therefore, comes with the electric spices meant to convey the crackle of the candy: black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, ginger. Languid honeycomb adds a sugary crunch, while an undercurrent of boozy red wine and animalic leather hint at the deeper, more adult pleasures down the road. If you'd like a grape scent with a bit of grown-up challenge hidden on the edges, Magenta Pop is a testament to coming of age that will make your mouth water- and your heart flutter."," Grape, amber, blueberry, honeycomb, rose, orris, coriander, black pepper, gingerbread, licorice, red wine, leather, atlas cedar, mandarin orange, tobacco, caramel, civet, cinnamon",prin lomros hope fear triumphs failure young love represent somewhat unlikely avatar pop rock not crazy may seem aside reliable source childhood nostalgia fizzy explode candy like experience make romantic awaken adolescence sweet painful exciting unpredictable fleeting concept behind magenta pop candyinspire summer scent sweet juicy occasionally painful romance magenta pop build around grape not fruity dimensionality wine table grape flatten purple sweetness ubiquitous candy flavor syrupy indulgent contrast therefore come electric spice mean convey crackle candy black pepper coriander cinnamon ginger languid honeycomb add sugary crunch undercurrent boozy red wine animalic leather hint deeply adult pleasure road would like grape scent bit grownup challenge hide edges magenta pop testament come age make mouth water heart flutter

la surprise eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by The Pursuit, one of four paintings that make up Jean-HonorÃ© Fragonard's ""The Process of Love"" collection, La Surprise is a bright and striking vintage-inflected feminine scent. The painting, meant to depict the first stage of love- courtship- shows a bold young man emerging into a garden where three young ladies are playing in a fountain, offering a rose to his beloved, who turns away in surprise. It's a painting of clever nuance, the outcome uncertain to all involved, from the unsteady suitor to the blushing courtesan to even the apprehensive cherub sculptures who loom above. It's a message, perhaps, about the risks one must take to find love, but also the triumphs that only such risks can produce. As such, La Surprise is a burst of bright, elegant energy, opening with a lovely spicy-green accord that would feel at home among the most romantic French chypres of years past.

l'aimee eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," L'AimÃ©e,  or ""The Beloved, "" is a famous 1794 oil portrait from French master Jacques-Louis David depicting his sister-in-law Madam SÃ©rizat. Painted shortly after his release from Robespierre's prisons following the French Revolution,  this masterwork is renowned for its effortless depiction of the subject's humanity,  portraying Madam SÃ©rizat holding a bouquet in one hand and her child's hand in the other. Its use of soft,  warm color,  as well as subtle touches of exquisite detail on the subject's hands and face,  work together to evoke emotional depth and authenticity that transcend mere photorealism- beneath the surface,  this painting truly breathes. What a delight,  therefore,  that Parfums MDCI has taken its subject to heart,  delivering a fragrance that also glows with abundant humanity and warmth. Despite a complex notes list of citrus,  fine florals,  and rich woods,  resins,  and musks,  L'AimÃ©e turns out to be a fragrance of exquisitely blended softness and light. In a sense,  it feels classical in its romantic depth,  but it surprisingly carries none of the room-filling ostentatiousness one might expect from the notes- there are no sharp edges,  no operatic swells and transitions- instead,  it's the lush romance of a perfectly tuned chamber orchestra. Florals and woods all float on a cloud of pillow-soft musk and vanilla,  aglow with the natural light of sweet fruit and the gentlest touch of castoreum. The result is a fragrance for romantics of all ages,  youthful enough for a princess,  elegant enough for a queen. Though for Monsieur David's sake,  we should point out one needn't support the monarchy to enjoy it."," Bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, Egyptian jasmine, Indian champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, Haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musks, castoreum",laimae beloved famous 1794 oil portrait french master jacqueslouis david depict sisterinlaw madam sarizat paint shortly release robespierre prison follow french revolution masterwork renowned effortless depiction subject humanity portray madam sarizat hold bouquet one hand childs hand use soft warm color well subtle touch exquisite detail subject hand face work together evoke emotional depth authenticity transcend mere photorealism beneath surface painting truly breathes delight therefore parfum mdci take subject heart deliver fragrance also glow abundant humanity warmth despite complex note list citrus fine floral rich wood resin musks laimae turn fragrance exquisitely blend softness light sense feel classical romantic depth surprisingly carry none roomfille ostentatiousness one may expect note no sharp edges no operatic swells transition instead lush romance perfectly tune chamber orchestra floral wood float cloud pillowsoft musk vanilla aglow natural light sweet fruit gentle touch castoreum result fragrance romantic age youthful enough princess elegant enough queen though monsieur davids sake point one need not support monarchy enjoy

When crushed ambergris sticks to blackcurrant and castoreum goes for a swim in a lake of osmanthus.

spicematic eau de parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The joy of Pierre Guillaume's ""flanker"" scents is that they're anything but retreads of their original inspiration- instead they have the iterative energy of a maestro composing variations on a theme, using the constraints of a single concept to focus his energy on the serendipitous.

meet me on the corner eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Meet Me On The Corner is a fragrance inspired by the 1970s but updated by about a half century. It's named after the Lindisfarne song, and captures the days when a date was just two people showing up to the same place at the same time- no texts, no swiping right, no GPS. It takes a staple of the '70s- the citrus chypre- and supplements the carefree excitement of the classic style with a serious dose of 2020 sophistication. The key to Meet Me On The Corner is three essential oils: mandora- a hybrid citrus born of sweet orange and mandarin, grown in Cyprus- plus magnolia flower, and magnolia leaf. Mandora gives the lemon and mandarin topnote a bright new sunshiny feeling. Using magnolia instead of the traditional tuberose and rosewood brings softness to the romantic heart of the scent. And in the base, all the hallmarks of a timeless chypre- moss, patchouli and styrax blended and matured in bergamot, surrounded by gentle musks. Think of this 1970-meets-2020 concept as a new Mini Cooper- all the fun of driving the original... now with working brakes and windshield wipers."," Lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musks, styrax, patchouli",meet corner fragrance inspire 1970s update half century name lindisfarne song capture day date two people show place time no text no swiping right no gps take staple 70 citrus chypre supplement carefree excitement classic style serious dose 2020 sophistication key meet corner three essential oil mandora hybrid citrus bear sweet orange mandarin grow cyprus plus magnolia flower magnolia leaf mandora give lemon mandarin topnote bright new sunshiny feel use magnolia instead traditional tuberose rosewood bring softness romantic heart scent base hallmarks timeless chypre moss patchouli styrax blend mature bergamot surround gentle musks think 1970meets2020 concept new mini cooper fun drive original work brake windshield wiper

peregrina extrait de parfum,Thameen," Even amongst the most famous precious stones in the world, La Peregrina stands out- a perfectly formed pear-shaped pearl, one of the largest in the world, with a stunning legacy that includes King Philip II of Spain, Napoleon III, and, more recently, Elizabeth Taylor. With a backstory like that, any fragrance to use the name had best be something special. Luckily, Peregrina, the newest from Thameen, is more than up to the challenge- a rich, warm blend of lush florals and spicy resins that exudes royal opulence and Old Hollywood glamour with equal abundance. Like its namesake pearl, Peregrina announces itself already fully formed, eschewing a traditional opening in favor of getting right to the rich, luscious heart of alluring myrrh, mouthwatering vanilla and a seductively sweet ylang ylang supplemented by Damascus rose, gardenia, and jasmine.

cigar rum eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," The name - Cigar Rum  is a bit on the nose. But the scent itself? A surprisingly delicate and detailed piece of work that, while definitely redolent of the rich, dried fruit and tobacco leaves soaking in oak caskets of Caribbean island booze implied in the name, has a lightness to it that makes it a fabulously easy wear. We think that part of what makes Cigar Rum such a great candidate for office wear and daytime is that the layers of balsamic woods, tobacco, and dried fruit are dry and crisp, aerated by a salty note that might be the seaweed absolute. The rum is rich and almost chocolatey in its booziness at first, but this fades quite quickly, leaving a cozy, toasted mÃ©lange of oaky tobacco and dried fruit to linger on the skin. In other words, people will think just that you smell deliciously cozy and warm', rather than suspecting you've been drinking. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar  and Cigar Rum just smells good."," raisin, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, seaweed absolute",name cigar rum bit nose scent surprisingly delicate detail piece work definitely redolent rich dry fruit tobacco leave soak oak casket caribbean island booze imply name lightness make fabulously easy wear think part make cigar rum great candidate office wear daytime layer balsamic wood tobacco dry fruit dry crisp aerate salty note may seaweed absolute rum rich almost chocolatey booziness first fade quite quickly leave cozy toast malange oaky tobacco dry fruit linger skin word people think smell deliciously cozy warm rather suspecting drinking sometimes cigar cigar cigar rum smell good

20 20 eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Berlin, 1920: the global excess of the Roaring Twenties is in full swing. Artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of New York, London, and Paris. And in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- CHIC, from J.F. Schwarzlose & SÃ¶hne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable German ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a Roaring Twenties of our own, J.F. Schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of CHIC with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes.

There is also a mysterious red berry note weaving in and out  an ice-covered raspberry that adds a dollop of deliciousness.

hongkong oolong eau de parfum,NEZ,"Hongkong Oolong captures the image of China as I see it in a few years, with its contrasts and modernity. This fragrance juxtaposes my interpretation of tea with the specificity of oolong. Designing a fragrance is always about adapting reality. I thought about what it is in tea that gives pleasure and comfort. So, I built the composition around musky notes, which reveal themselves generously, like the long finish you get with a mature tea. Spicy inflections of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger reproduce the warming effect of a hearty mouthful. A base of sandalwood and tonka bean round off the accord with a milky sweetness. Then, I incorporated the specific characteristics of oolong and that floral lightness; jasmine, honeysuckle, with its fruity and honeyed accents, and a touch of magnolia, which I associate iwth China. Lastly, hints of leather, incense and moss transform the green, vegetal freshness of the tea leaf to bring out its fermented character.","Tea, Oolong, Musk, Spicy, Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamom, Ginger, Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Sweet, Milky, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Fruity, Honey, Magnolia",hongkong oolong capture image china see year contrast modernity fragrance juxtapose interpretation tea specificity oolong design fragrance always adapt reality think tea give pleasure comfort build composition around musky note reveal generously like long finish get mature tea spicy inflection cinnamon clove cardamom ginger reproduce warm effect hearty mouthful base sandalwood tonka bean round accord milky sweetness incorporated specific characteristics oolong floral lightness jasmine honeysuckle fruity honey accent touch magnolia associate iwth china lastly hint leather incense moss transform green vegetal freshness tea leaf bring ferment character
salted green mango eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Salted Green Mango is utterly unique, and dare we say it, one of Strangers Parfumerie's best. There are green fragrances, there are sour fragrances, there are dry fragrances -  Salted Green Mango manages to be all of the above, but with an otherworldly, exotic flair that defies description. Ostensibly an ode to Bao mango, a green, tart mango native to the  Southern part of Thailand, where perfumer Prin Lomros was born and raised, there is nothing really sweet or juicy about the fruit note here. Instead, the mango is a thing of rare, desiccated beauty - a dark green rind dipped in sea salt that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth only to think of it.Why would this be refreshing or appetizing? We don't know, but it just is. Salted Green Mango is a green fruit devoid of sweetness, moisture, or sparkle  instead, it draws us into the shadows of a mineral vetiver and the pleasant bitterness of inedible fruit that is all rind and pith. Salted Green Mango is the crawlspace where we find the coolness and repose we crave in the hottest of weather."," green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed",salt green mango utterly unique dare say one stranger parfumerie good green fragrance sour fragrance dry fragrance salt green mango manage otherworldly exotic flair defie description ostensibly ode bao mango green tart mango native southern part thailand perfumer prin lomros bear raise nothing really sweet juicy fruit note instead mango thing rare desiccated beauty dark green rind dip sea salt suck moisture mouth think would refreshing appetize not know salt green mango green fruit devoid sweetness moisture sparkle instead draws us shadow mineral vetiver pleasant bitterness inedible fruit rind pith salt green mango crawlspace find coolness repose crave hot weather
sm cafe eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," SM CafÃ© is half cafÃ©, half sado-masochism. An erotic coffee shop, as perfumer Prin Lomros playfully points out. Yes, it does sound rather dirty  but honestly  SM CafÃ© is nowhere near as scandalous as it sounds. Put your misgivings to one side, for SM CafÃ© is simply the glorious coming together of a delicious, aromatic fresh-roasted coffee aroma and a smoky boot leather aroma. Think AomassaÃ¯ or Coze (Parfumerie Generale) on steroids. We smell two distinct and entrancing accords here  the first, a pure espresso darkness mingling with a sweet and creamy waffle cone note, which conjures up the realistic aroma of a cafÃ© ambiance, and second, the smoky, woody scent of freshly-waxed leather boots. Naughty or just nice? Wear it and decide for yourself. We think it's one of the all-time coffee greats."," coffee absolute, Russian leather, suede, Javanol, lavender, amber, benzoin, tobacco, cade, Atlas cedarwood, tonka bean, beeswax absolute, maraschino cherry, patchouli, cashmeran, rose",sm cafa half cafa half sadomasochism erotic coffee shop perfumer prin lomros playfully point yes sound rather dirty honestly sm cafa nowhere near scandalous sound put misgiving one side sm cafa simply glorious come together delicious aromatic freshroaste coffee aroma smoky boot leather aroma think aomassaa coze parfumerie generale steroid smell two distinct entrancing accord first pure espresso darkness mingle sweet creamy waffle cone note conjure realistic aroma cafa ambiance second smoky woody scent freshlywaxed leather boot naughty nice wear decide think one alltime coffee great
aroon sawat eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Aroon Sawat, meaninggood morning! in Thai, is part of Strangers Parfumerie's 24/7 series. Inspired by the gentle warmth of the morning sun, the scent was composed by perfumer Prin Lomros with the specific intent of capturing all the golden tones implied in the country's original name of Siam, which is thought to have originated in the word Suvannaphumi, meaning Land of Gold.And indeed, Aroon Sawat is a perfume rich in warm, ambered notes that seem to shimmer like particles of gold dust caught in sunlight. Thick, syrupy plums, mango, and ripe passionfruit are suspended in multiple layers of hazy woods, ambers, and resins for a smoky incense effect that lingers all day. Think plumes of rich myrrh and sandalwood incense pouring out of an ancient Thai temple and mingling with the heady scent of ripe stone fruits and white flowers in nearby orchards. Yet, in the midst of all these rich, smoky aromas, there is a thread of freshness  from the citrus, or the sour mango  that cuts through the velveteen texture of the scent and allows air to circulate. It's divine. And if you love woody-ambery-leathery scents such as Costume National or Ombre Indigo (or even Chambre Noir) by Olfactive Studio, then Aroon Sawat could scratch the same itch."," golden mango, Marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin",aroon sawat meaninggood morning thai part stranger parfumerie 24 7 series inspire gentle warmth morning sun scent compose perfumer prin lomros specific intent capture golden tone imply countrys original name siam think originated word suvannaphumi meaning land gold indeed aroon sawat perfume rich warm ambere note seem shimmer like particle gold dust catch sunlight thick syrupy plum mango ripe passionfruit suspend multiple layer hazy wood amber resin smoky incense effect linger day think plume rich myrrh sandalwood incense pour ancient thai temple mingle heady scent ripe stone fruit white flower nearby orchard yet midst rich smoky aromas thread freshness citrus sour mango cut velveteen texture scent allow air circulate divine love woodyamberyleathery scent costume national ombre indigo even chambre noir olfactive studio aroon sawat could scratch itch
burning ben eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Burning Ben belongs to Prin Lomros' LGBTQ series, and was inspired by a subtle moment in the South Korean movie   ""Burning where theBen character struggles with a conversation that might be interpreted as homophobic, dredging up a host of complex feelings in himself. Burning Ben is a stunning phenolic scent that similarly unites all sorts of opposing elements  hazelnut, beeswax, burning tires, leather, and forest fruit  creating a surprisingly harmonious andcomplete whole, just like the conflicted humanity of Ben.Burning Ben opens with a hugely realistic shot of espresso, with the dark, roasted flavor of beans brought perhaps a hair too far to burning point. Doused in a black, almost chewy sweet, spicy smoke, it feels like walking through the aftermath of a fire. But fear not, for the smoke clears and lifts in places, revealing intriguing hints of nuts, berries, saffron, and plums, notes that lend the austere smoke a gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness. A caramelized-butter amber, incense, and beeswax tandem shore all of this up from the basenotes, for a complex and rich finish that dawdles pleasurably between sweet, smoky, spicy, and sandalwoody without alighting completely on one or the other. If you love phenolic scents such as The Black Knight by Francesca Bianchi or T-Rex by Zoologist but want something softer and subtler for daytime wear, then Burning Ben could be for you."," hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, Javanol, saffron, burning tire",burn ben belong prin lomros lgbtq series inspire subtle moment south korean movie burn theben character struggle conversation may interpret homophobic dredging host complex feeling burn ben stunning phenolic scent similarly unite sort oppose element hazelnut beeswax burn tire leather forest fruit create surprisingly harmonious andcomplete whole like conflicted humanity ben burn ben open hugely realistic shoot espresso dark roast flavor bean bring perhaps hair far burn point douse black almost chewy sweet spicy smoke feel like walk aftermath fire fear not smoke clear lift place reveal intriguing hint nuts berry saffron plum note lend austere smoke gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness caramelizedbutter amber incense beeswax tandem shore basenote complex rich finish dawdles pleasurably sweet smoky spicy sandalwoody without alight completely one love phenolic scent black knight francesca bianchi trex zoologist want something soft subtler daytime wear burn ben could
cigar rum intense extrait de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," If you loved the original Cigar Rum but longed for more heft, more richness....more everything  then the Extrait version, Cigar Rum Intense, is for you. Sculpting the original's bright, punchy booze-and-tobacco into a new and more mature direction, Cigar Rum Intense leans on a dark, resinous coffee absolute, a dash of cinnamon, and a strong  aquatic note to mark itself out as a different animal. Compared to its predecessor, Cigar Rum Intense is altogether a more muscular affair, an injection of briny radiance lifting and hoisting the richly spicy tobacco, booze, and dried fruit accords over the last mile. It lasts forever. Surprisingly, Cigar Rum Intense also smells fresher; a rugged, outdoorsy version of the casual island bar vibe of the original. In the far drydown, a gorgeously silky, masculine-leaning musk emerges, shot thrown by the spicy bay rum' bitterness of copaiba, a greenish-gold tree resin native to Brazil. While Cigar Rum is for the young buck, let's say that Cigar Rum Intense is for the man (or woman) who has arrived at the top and isn't afraid to signal it."," raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute",love original cigar rum long heft richnessmore everything extrait version cigar rum intense sculpt original bright punchy boozeandtobacco new mature direction cigar rum intense leans dark resinous coffee absolute dash cinnamon strong aquatic note mark different animal compare predecessor cigar rum intense altogether muscular affair injection briny radiance lift hoist richly spicy tobacco booze dry fruit accord last mile last forever surprisingly cigar rum intense also smell fresher rugged outdoorsy version casual island bar vibe original far drydown gorgeously silky masculineleane musk emerge shoot throw spicy bay rum bitterness copaiba greenishgold tree resin native brazil cigar rum young buck let us say cigar rum intense man woman arrive top not afraid signal
oliver eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Oliver is an original take on the aromatic herbs and citrus freshness of the traditional eau de cologne. At first, you smell the bright, tart (and always oddly dry) burst of citrus notes of the classic Farina or 4177, with their cleansing and pure aroma designed by nature to awaken and refresh the senses, supported by the crisp, herbal undergrowth of basil leaf, clary sage, and cool, green cypresses. But as the more volatile aromatic notes burn off, you notice some subtly non-traditional notes in the background. There is the musky scent of a man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly from his warm body, introducing a beautifully intimate and human tone (we suspect the glowy magic of ambrette seed and ambergris to be the responsible parties here). Then there is the exciting tang of sea salt, the dry rosy leather of quince, the incensey bitterness of oakmoss, and the powdered plushness of triple-milled French iris soap. Oliver feels personal. It's far more evolved than it ought to be, for all its eau de cologne inspiration. It makes sense to us that this raspy, oddball freshie was inspired by the bittersweet love story of two young men on the cusp between childhood and adulthood in the acclaimed indie movie Call Me by Your Name."," bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)",oliver original take aromatic herbs citrus freshness traditional eau de cologne first smell bright tart always oddly dry burst citrus note classic farina 4177 cleanse pure aroma design nature awaken refresh sense support crisp herbal undergrowth basil leaf clary sage cool green cypress volatile aromatic note burn notice subtly nontraditional note background musky scent mans crisp white linen shirt pull freshly warm body introduce beautifully intimate human tone suspect glowy magic ambrette seed ambergris responsible party exciting tang sea salt dry rosy leather quince incensey bitterness oakmoss powder plushness triplemille french iris soap oliver feel personal far evolve ought eau de cologne inspiration make sense us raspy oddball freshie inspire bittersweet love story two young man cusp childhood adulthood acclaim indie movie call name
lumberjack cologne eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Lumberjack Cologne smells exactly as advertized  a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! Prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a North American lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. As he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. There is a flash of bitter citrus and Scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. Lumberjack Cologne just smells great  a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. And that is what Lumberjack Cologne is."," lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",lumberjack cologne smell exactly advertized bright herbal eau de colognestyle scent build around invigorate scent freshlyfelle lumber prin pegs inspiration scent scent rise dampen shirt north american lumberjack long morning cut timber mop sweaty brow lean inhale clean healthy smell warm skin sawdust great redwoods touching gasoline smell see tool flash bitter citrus scandinavian herbs opening make us think simple timeless eau de cologne man may apply early morning head forest lumberjack cologne smell great spacious airy woody scent teem aromatic aroma tree sap citrus herbs fresh air clean skin cut wood nothing nothing less sometimes make sense not overthink kind rippedfromnature smell make us happy lumberjack cologne
sangre dulce eau de parfum,Strangers Parfumerie," Sangre Dulce is a weird and yet completely wearable gourmand idea born out of Prin Lomros' love for two specific movies. The sangre' part of the title, meaning blood (or family ties), represents the crazy lifestyle and mores of the strange religious cult in Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre, and the dulce' part (sweet) comes from the lurid hallucinations experienced by party goers upon ingesting a cocktail laced with LSD  in the French movie ""Climax"" by Gaspar NoÃ©. Based on the inspiration, we expect an oddball mixture of sweet and inedible elements that have been thrown together in a somewhat wild and unconventional manner. And that is exactly what we get! A wild pinprick burst of woodland strawberries, technicolor in their juicy sweetness, imploding over and over again in a beescomb, their pulpy scent muffled by a molten pour of pure gold honey. But there is also a softly musky tobacco-ish accord, shot through with rosewater marshmallow fluff, and buttery ylang sharpened to a spike with blood orange. It is both sweet and not sweet, edible and firmly inedible, all at once. The balance here is superb, refining a cornucopia of fruits, burnt sugar, and balsams to a slim and elegant peak that is unusual in the gourmand genre. Consider us astonished and delighted!"," sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang ylang, benzoin, Peru balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange",sangre dulce weird yet completely wearable gourmand idea bear prin lomros love two specific movie sangre part title meaning blood family tie represent crazy lifestyle strange religious cult alejandro jodorowskys santa sangre dulce part sweet come lurid hallucination experienced party goer upon ingest cocktail lace lsd french movie climax gaspar noa base inspiration expect oddball mixture sweet inedible element throw together somewhat wild unconventional manner exactly get wild pinprick burst woodland strawberry technicolor juicy sweetness implode beescomb pulpy scent muffle molten pour pure gold honey also softly musky tobaccoish accord shoot rosewater marshmallow fluff buttery ylang sharpen spike blood orange sweet not sweet edible firmly inedible balance superb refining cornucopia fruit burn sugar balsams slim elegant peak unusual gourmand genre consider us astonished delighted
mandarava extrait de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Inspired by the vision of sweet yellow flowers, white elephants, and towering mountain peaks that make up the Thai vision of Trayastrimsa  the Buddhist Nirvana or Afterlife - Mandarava is perfumer Prin Lomros' interpretation of what heaven smells like. At first, heaven smells like a lei of heady tropical flowers laid around your neck, the lushness of ripe jasmine, rice pudding-esque champaca, and buttery, banana-rich ylang sending the senses reeling. There is an impression of red fruit swollen with juices, threatening to burst out of the pollen-soaked flowers and run down your arm uninterrupted. But this is no innocent, girlish affair. Mandarava shows us that flowers can be downright filthy when they want to be. The lasciviousness of the Hindi oud couples furiously with a sharp civet and earthy cumin to lend the floral bouquet a spicy animalic edge that seems lifted out of 1980s powerhouse canon, before the reformulation bug bit. Now envisage this dense, spicy floral knot being lifted and diffused by a clean, powdery nag champa musk and soft incense ash, wafting in and out of the animalic floral oud notes to breathe air into the composition. After smelling both Ma Nishtana and Mandarava, we are calling Prin Lomros the Master of the Eastern incense theme in perfumery, hands down."," bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, Himalayan champaca, Madagascar ylang ylang, Indian marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, Mysore sandalwood, Assamese oud (Hindi), Indonesian patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, Siamese benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash",inspire vision sweet yellow flower white elephant tower mountain peak make thai vision trayastrimsa buddhist nirvana afterlife mandarava perfumer prin lomros interpretation heaven smell like first heaven smell like lei heady tropical flower lay around neck lushness ripe jasmine rice puddingesque champaca buttery bananarich ylang send sense reel impression red fruit swollen juice threaten burst pollensoake flower run arm uninterrupted no innocent girlish affair mandarava show us flower downright filthy want lasciviousness hindi oud couple furiously sharp civet earthy cumin lend floral bouquet spicy animalic edge seem lift 1980s powerhouse canon reformulation bug bit envisage dense spicy floral knot lift diffuse clean powdery nag champa musk soft incense ash waft animalic floral oud note breathe air composition smell nishtana mandarava call prin lomros master eastern incense theme perfumery hand
ma nishtana extrait de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Ma Nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""Why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of Had Gadya (the Chava Alberstein version). In a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask,why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?. After all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. Well, Ma Nishtana is something special.Standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of Comme des Garcons' Avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of Grimoire by Anatole LeBreton, Ma Nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. Instead, it is both, all at once. Its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. There is incense  mixed incense resins rather than any single one  smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of Buddhist temple'-like mysticism. But there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. Austerity balanced by comfort. If you're on an incense quest, then Ma Nishtana might just be your final destination."," saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, Norlimbanol, clove, allspice",nishtana first two word phrase meaning tonight different night take story lyric gadya chava alberstein version way make sense turn philosophical question head askwhy incense scent different incense scent incense crowd genre really take something special stand well nishtana something special stand somewhere soar ethereality comme des garcon avignon spice human weirdness grimoire anatole lebreton nishtana unusual refusal commit either coolness warmth instead opening smoky myrrh explode cloud fizzy aldehyde feel cool immediately bold dose saffron nutmeg black pepper cumin cardamom burn cloud ash smoke turn heat incense mixed incense resin rather single one smoldering nearby censor create aura buddhist templelike mysticism also spicy warmth thicklyfruite tea breads pain depice percolate beneath fill hollow austerity balance comfort incense quest nishtana may final destination
thichila eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the Eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic Thai herbs and spices. Either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm.  The composition of Thichila is a marvel. Although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic Thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of Wan Sao Lhong - a traditional Thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - Thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. An unctuous combo of champaca flower and Indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. But blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that Siam oud. In Thai folklore, Wan Sao Lhong is feted as a love potion. And while Thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted  drunk on this Thai love potion."," saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, Indian tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, Thai oud, Mysore sandalwood, Indonesian vetiver, cinnamon bark, Wan Sao Lhong ( Amomum Biflorum Jack)",thichila stunning floriental incense scent compose eastern style keep guess whether floral oud oudy floral luscious floral bouquet awash exotic thai herbs spice either way scent present everchange picture like landscape red gold sand shift sandstorm composition thichila marvel although core scent revolve around hefty dose animalic thai oud dress minty camphoraceous freshness wan sao lhong traditional thai plant look like flower smell like herb thichila fool us first explode onto skin bombastic floral unctuous combo champaca flower indian tuberose tangle spicy saffron tangy kaffir lime create phantasm jungly ylang ylang blink know floral sweetness rein dark earthy myrrh rough leathery funk siam oud thai folklore wan sao lhong fete love potion thichila could little challenge oud beginner one sniff enchant drunk thai love potion
mohragot eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Mohragot, meaningemerald in Thai, is an aromatic, muscular masculine that draws on the classical European fougÃ¨re for structure but twists it in a distinctly Eastern direction for a scent that will surprise and delight even the most jaded of palates. Exotic touches such as earthy betel leaf, milky-green-sweet pandan leaf, and dusty, tobacco-ish chalood bark  all materials indigenous to South East Asian countries such as Thailand and India  make it clear that, although we can smell the inky bitterness of oakmoss and the dark green herbal undergrowth of the classic European forest shifting underneath, we are in unfamiliar territory. And it's a thrilling realization.Thus, in the place of dewy ferns and bright lavender, we smell the damp, reddish soil of the Thai jungle, which mingles with the chewy, green perfumeyness of sweet pandan leaves to create a deeply green, spicy aroma that soothes and excites all at once. In the base, Thai oud joins with a flinty, minty oakmoss and the coumarin-like nuances of chalood bark for a finish that is softly musky and woodsy, gently disengaging the scent from its aromatic topnotes. For those who love the classical fougÃ¨re genre but wish it were a bit more innovative or exotic, Mohragot should be on your test list."," betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, Thai oud, sandalwood, Thai vetiver, oakmoss",mohragot meaningemerald thai aromatic muscular masculine draws classical european fouga structure twist distinctly eastern direction scent surprise delight even jade palate exotic touch earthy betel leaf milkygreensweet pandan leaf dusty tobaccoish chalood bark material indigenous south east asian country thailand india make clear although smell inky bitterness oakmoss dark green herbal undergrowth classic european forest shift underneath unfamiliar territory thrill realization thus place dewy fern bright lavender smell damp reddish soil thai jungle mingle chewy green perfumeyness sweet pandan leave create deeply green spicy aroma soothes excites base thai oud join flinty minty oakmoss coumarinlike nuance chalood bark finish softly musky woodsy gently disengage scent aromatic topnote love classical fouga genre wish bit innovative exotic mohragot test list
tiwa eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Tiwa, Thai fordaytime, is a radiant floral citrus scent that representsthe scents of home for perfumer Prin Lomros, conjuring up the aromatic, fresh scent of local herbs being simmered in a pot by neighbors, nearby citrus orchards, and the lingering smoke of precious woods being dried in sheds. Tiwa belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Tiwa is a beautifully fresh, herbal take on the traditional citrus eau de cologne idea. The herbs in the opening are undeniably exotic, with a mouthwateringly savory, minty Thai basil duking it out with sour kaffir lime, spicy finger root oil, and an earthy green celery seed. The bright, tart citrus notes play second fiddle to the herbs for a while, but eventually jostle their way to the front, for an effect that is akin to Diorella or Eau Sauvage covered in verdant Thai foliage. The herbaciousness dies back eventually to reveal a rich, soapy orange blossom freshness that lingers on the skin for hours, like the warmth of a late afternoon sun. Fresh, tart, and rich, Tiwa is an upgrade on the eau de cologne theme that you'd be crazy to miss out on.Made with 100% Natural materials"," tangerine, kaffir limes, orange flower absolute, petitgrain, holy basil, cananga, finger root oil, Indonesian patchouli, guava leaf, lime, celery seed, vetiver, Australian sandalwood",tiwa thai fordaytime radiant floral citrus scent representsthe scent home perfumer prin lomros conjure aromatic fresh scent local herbs simmer pot neighbor nearby citrus orchard linger smoke precious wood dry sheds tiwa belong thammachatr thai natural series thus compose 100 allnatural raw material tiwa beautifully fresh herbal take traditional citrus eau de cologne idea herbs opening undeniably exotic mouthwateringly savory minty thai basil duke sour kaffir lime spicy finger root oil earthy green celery seed bright tart citrus note play second fiddle herbs eventually jostle way front effect akin diorella eau sauvage cover verdant thai foliage herbaciousness die back eventually reveal rich soapy orange blossom freshness linger skin hour like warmth late afternoon sun fresh tart rich tiwa upgrade eau de cologne theme would crazy miss make 100 natural material
tom yum eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Oh boy  just say the word Tom Yum and our mouths water. And the perfume Tom Yum has precisely the same effect. Spritz it on and your senses are instantly afire. Inspired by the famously sweet and sour Tom Yum soup of Thailand, Tom Yum (the scent) belongs to Prissana's Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, meaning that it is all natural  more a recipe than a formula, almost. An extra inducement to lick your own skin when you're wearing it.Tom Yum smells immediately like a steaming hot bowl of Tom Yum. Exploding with bright, citrusy lemongrass and coriander flavors, it is a perfect balance of hot, sweet, sour, and herbal. The flavors seem to go 1,000 leagues deep in each direction. The gingery heat of galangal is cooled by the soapy, lemony grassiness of coriander for a sensory experience that feels invigorating and exciting. Keeping all these explosive herbal and citrus notes in check is a backing of nutty, smoky chalood bark, and a soft sigh's worth of jasmine. Wonderful for a hot summer's day, when a dramatic twist on the traditional eau de cologne-style refreshment is called for.Made with 100% natural materials"," Lime, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, petitgrain, jasmine absolute, galangal, coriander, patchouli, grapefruit, lemon, chalood bark",oh boy say word tom yum mouth water perfume tom yum precisely effect spritz sense instantly afire inspire famously sweet sour tom yum soup thailand tom yum scent belong prissanas thammachatr thai natural series meaning natural recipe formula almost extra inducement lick skin wear tom yum smell immediately like steam hot bowl tom yum explode bright citrusy lemongrass coriander flavor perfect balance hot sweet sour herbal flavor seem go 1000 league deep direction gingery heat galangal cool soapy lemony grassiness coriander sensory experience feel invigorate exciting keep explosive herbal citrus note check back nutty smoky chalood bark soft sigh worth jasmine wonderful hot summer day dramatic twist traditional eau de colognestyle refreshment call make 100 natural material
natsumeku eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Natsumeku is the Japanese word for the start of the summer and is inspired by the pleasant memory of a day perfumer Prin Lomros spent wandering around the Japanese countryside on a bright, cloudless spring day. Belonging to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, Natsumeku is composed of 100% all-natural raw materials. Natsumeku is pure sunshine in a bottle. Imagine an entire Japanese yuzu tree  the variety of citrus native to Japan  pulped, distilled, and poured into a small clear bottle, and that is what it smells like. The traditional woods of Japan  silvery hinoki wood and green, minty-rosy camphor  form the subtle backing to the main players, which are the stunning liquid sunshine of yuzu (both the peel and the fruit), the dark green leaves clustered around the fruit (neroli), and the bittersweet lime twang of bergamot. Being all natural, this joyful explosion of multi-faceted citrus fruits cannot last forever, but the perfumer has cleverly extended the citrus loveliness as far as he can by way of a classically clean, soapy neroli accord that seems to go on forever.Made with 100% Natural materials"," camphor, yuzu, hinoki, orange bitter, mandarin, lavender, neroli, orris butter, rose otto, oakmoss, artemisia, bergamot, tangerine, palo santo",natsumeku japanese word start summer inspire pleasant memory day perfumer prin lomros spend wander around japanese countryside bright cloudless spring day belong thammachatr thai natural series natsumeku compose 100 allnatural raw material natsumeku pure sunshine bottle imagine entire japanese yuzu tree variety citrus native japan pulp distil pour small clear bottle smell like traditional wood japan silvery hinoki wood green mintyrosy camphor form subtle back main player stunning liquid sunshine yuzu peel fruit dark green leave cluster around fruit neroli bittersweet lime twang bergamot natural joyful explosion multifacete citrus fruit not last forever perfumer cleverly extended citrus loveliness far way classically clean soapy neroli accord seem go forever make 100 natural material
maruyama eau de parfum,Parfum Prissana," Maruyama, the name of a Japanese mountain, is a scent inspired by a visit made by perfumer Prin Lomros to a herb and flower garden in Sapporo, Hokkaido Japan, an island famous for its incredible diversity of rare medicinal herbs and flowers native to Japan. Using a natural and rare blue chamomile that tints the liquid an unusual blue hue*, Maruyama belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Maruyama is a rich, savory-herbal woody scent teeming with the surprising aromas of freshly roast coffee beans, caramelized brown sugar, amber, and celery root  notes that cannot be explained by the notes list. Rather, this is alchemic magic worked by the combination of unusual materials such as lovage root and blue chamomile, herbal notes that have an odd, unexpected richness and dimension to them. Quirky and entrancing, this chorus of brown', sweetly aromatic notes proves to be robust, lasting throughout the day until the vegetal muskiness of ambrette seed diffuses it all out into a soft, woodsy haze. If you are fond of rich but kind of weird, offbeat herbal or woody perfumes such as Comme des Garcons' Sequoia, then Maruyama is for you.Made with 100% Natural materials*Please note that due to Maruyama's all-natural ingredients, the fragrance may change color to a dark grey/purple.

if by rk eau de parfum,Frapin," ""If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you...""So begins Rudyard Kipling's legendary poem, which, for all the striking and undeniable faults of the author, has endured to become a paean to lives lived with clear eyes and gusto, lives where, to paraphrase Kipling, Triumph and Disaster are two imposters to be treated just the same. Inspired by his grandfather's spirited retelling of the poem, Frapin artistic director David Frossard was traveling south down the Indian coast when he was struck with the desire to create a scent dedicated to travel, adventure, self-discovery, and constant personal improvement. The scent itself is a dashingly spicy masculine that whisks us across the subcontinent with fiery pepper from Karnataka igniting a heady dose of ginger and cinnamon, before balancing it out with a cool, milky fig. At the intersection of spicy and creamy is the main ingredient, precious sandalwood from Mysore, the finest in the world, which finds robust partners in a base of Indonesian patchouli, Peruvian guaiac, and Venezuelan tonka- a rich, smooth, powerful combination for any man ready to seize his destiny. Make no mistake- Kipling himself was not, by any means, a role model. But If by RK transcends the flaws of the man to capture the core of why his words have remained so firmly etched in the public consciousness for all these years."," Ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean",keep head lose blame youso begin rudyard kipling legendary poem strike undeniable fault author endure become paean life live clear eye gusto life paraphrase kiple triumph disaster two imposter treat inspire grandfather spirited retell poem frapin artistic director david frossard travel south indian coast strike desire create scent dedicated travel adventure selfdiscovery constant personal improvement scent dashingly spicy masculine whisks us across subcontinent fiery pepper karnataka ignite heady dose ginger cinnamon balance cool milky fig intersection spicy creamy main ingredient precious sandalwood mysore fine world find robust partner base indonesian patchouli peruvian guaiac venezuelan tonka rich smooth powerful combination man ready seize destiny make no mistake kiple not mean role model rk transcend flaw man capture core word remain firmly etched public consciousness year
musc moschus eau de parfum,Rania J.," What makes a perfect winter musk scent? For us, it's a fragrance that can balance the deep, sensual aspects of musk with its fresher, brighter aspects to create something both comforting and stylish- in other words, a scent that wears as well on a bright, clear winter morning as it does in the middle of a blizzard. And Musc Moschus nails this balancing act perfectly- warm yet bright, sweet yet gentle, it's the kind of effortlessly beautiful musk scent that can take the edge off the chilliest day, but won't overwhelm even when you're right next to the fireplace. The secret is the interplay between the strong, lovely base of white musk- at once both smooth and warm- and a strikingly lovely sweet and fruity opening- tart berries and juicy blackcurrant with just the right touch of sugar to feel festive but fresh. Creamy sandalwood and vanilla enhance the richness of the musk, and a perfect touch of iris adds sophistication and depth. It's the perfect scent to carry you through family gatherings and new-year adventures alike. In fact, there's really only one drawback- like winter itself, Musc Moschus is a limited edition that won't be available once 2020 rolls around, so don't miss your opportunity to get a bottle."," Bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musks",make perfect winter musk scent us fragrance balance deep sensual aspect musk fresher bright aspect create something comfort stylish word scent wear well bright clear winter morning middle blizzard musc moschus nail balance act perfectly warm yet bright sweet yet gentle kind effortlessly beautiful musk scent take edge chilly day not overwhelm even right next fireplace secret interplay strong lovely base white musk smooth warm strikingly lovely sweet fruity opening tart berry juicy blackcurrant right touch sugar feel festive fresh creamy sandalwood vanilla enhance richness musk perfect touch iris add sophistication depth perfect scent carry family gathering newyear adventure alike fact really one drawback like winter musc moschus limited edition not available 2020 roll around not miss opportunity get bottle
war and peace ii extrait de parfum,Areej Le Dore," War and Peace II is an olfactory battle of life and death, where precious aromatics that are complete opposites clash and then infuse into one another, finding balance and harmony.In the opening, the composition explodes with a smoky incense represented by Himalayan fossilized amber resin over 35 million years old. This prehistoric substance was dry distilled, allowing it to break and release its ancient spirit. These deep anddark incensy notes layer with one of the softest aromatics known to man: rose. Leathery, balsamic, slightly piney resin incense lays atop the freshly distilled virgin soul of Indian rose: Ruh Gulab, one of the most precious oils in India. A soft, silky rose cloud, covered in ancient black smoke, a flawless marriage of darkness and light.Powdery and sticky sweet orris root absolute supports the rose, pulling it into the heart, where aged and soothing, chocolaty patchouli awaits. Warm, sensual orris root absolute in combination with Ruh Gulab conveys the feelings of peace and glory, and brings a burst of life into the composition.Suddenly, everything that came before is swallowed by the power of nuclear, natural musks. Thick, dark waves of salty ambergris, furry deer musk and dirty black leather of castoreum, co-extracted all together by Russian Adam, create a sensation of loud, struggling, deadly war. Animalics take over, capturing and captivating everything along the way. Wild, ferocious currents of civet take the invasion to an even deeper level. Wafts of smoky amber return to the scene, coupled with one of the most leathery, dirty vetivers, creating a bold, olfactory drama. And when the spectacular aromatic battle has finally mellowed, dry and heavy animalic leather remains to dominate at the base; intense and regal, smooth and sensual, leather that lasts for hours and hours...Here we have faced a juxtaposition of black and white, of life and death, and through it all, we discover in this calmly aggressive composition a harmonious balance. This olfactory poem, War and Peace, will satisfy even the most adventurous fragrance lover.Version II has been updated with ""more refinement"" to the ingredients and structure of the fragrance specifically the patchouli and orris root","Amber Resin, Smoky Incense, Rose, Leathery, Balsamic, Chocolaty, Patchouli",war peace ii olfactory battle life death precious aromatics complete opposite clash infuse one another find balance harmony opening composition explode smoky incense represent himalayan fossilize amber resin 35 million year old prehistoric substance dry distil allow break release ancient spirit deep dark incensy note layer one soft aromatics know man rise leathery balsamic slightly piney resin incense lays atop freshly distil virgin soul indian rise ruh gulab one precious oil india soft silky rise cloud cover ancient black smoke flawless marriage darkness light powdery sticky sweet orris root absolute support rise pull heart aged soothe chocolaty patchouli awaits warm sensual orris root absolute combination ruh gulab convey feeling peace glory bring burst life composition suddenly everything come swallow power nuclear natural musks thick dark wave salty ambergris furry deer musk dirty black leather castoreum coextracte together russian adam create sensation loud struggle deadly war animalics take capture captivate everything along way wild ferocious current civet take invasion even deeply level wafts smoky amber return scene couple one leathery dirty vetiver create bold olfactory drama spectacular aromatic battle finally mellow dry heavy animalic leather remain dominate base intense regal smooth sensual leather last hour hour face juxtaposition black white life death discover calmly aggressive composition harmonious balance olfactory poem war peace satisfy even adventurous fragrance lover version ii update refinement ingredient structure fragrance specifically patchouli orris root
ummo eau de parfum,Xinu," Ummo is a tribute to tobacco, one of the most representative and symbolic plants of the American continent. The smoke given off by the dried leaves of tobacco is considered sacred and has been used for spiritual rituals, healing, and purification ceremonies since long before European commodification made the plant synonymous with indulgence and bad habits. It's this older, purer expression of tobacco that makes Ummo such a uniquely potent and spiritual experience- as rich and spicy as any tobacco scent, but with a gorgeously naturalistic green floral character, enhanced with fresh jasmine tobacco flowers and the sweet resinousness of styrax. A warm but bright tonka and cedar base manages to feel both ethereal and comforting, establishing Ummo as a uniquely soulful tobacco scent, and a welcome addition to Xinu's already impressive lineup."," Virginia tobacco, Jasmine tobacco, Styrax, Tonka bean, Juniper",ummo tribute tobacco one representative symbolic plant american continent smoke give dry leave tobacco consider sacred use spiritual ritual healing purification ceremony since long european commodification make plant synonymous indulgence bad habit old purer expression tobacco make ummo uniquely potent spiritual experience rich spicy tobacco scent gorgeously naturalistic green floral character enhance fresh jasmine tobacco flower sweet resinousness styrax warm bright tonka cedar base manage feel ethereal comfort establish ummo uniquely soulful tobacco scent welcome addition xinus already impressive lineup

And while decadent confections and many-tiered cakes may be the stuff of fairytales, sometimes the most memorable indulgences in real life are as simple as a mouthwatering handful of caramel popcorn. That's the pleasure of What About Pop, a delectable new gourmand built around a perfect note of salted, buttery, caramel-enveloped popcorn.

dendera extrait de parfum,Centauri Perfumes," Dendera is inspired by the great ancient Egyptian civilization and the mystery and immense beauty they left behind. The Dendera complex itself is a unique temple, famous for itsDendera Lightbulbs and built upon a much older temple complex newly discovered beneath its floors. The top notes open with rich spices, cinnamon and nutmeg for a  warm and inviting beginning. A resinous natural incense accord built upon frankincense and myrrh continues to entice as the scent starts to dry down. The natural Moroccan orris butter has a dry dusty tonality with a gently sweet Rooibos tea like quality. The combination of the orris with the earthy Vietnamese oud is a beautifully dry and rich accord reminiscent of Egyptian desert sands. As it dries down through the resinous incense base a creamy Indian sandalwood comes through, becoming softly coated in a sparkling fine musky white ambergris, a touch of vanilla adds a hint of sweetness.

divine vanille eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," When you have a raw material as glorious as vanilla absolute from Madagascar, the smart thing to do is to let it shine. And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme  addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.This clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers  the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity. Divine Vanille is mysterious, yet easy to read - the perfect balance between simple and complex."," Clary sage, cinnamon, black pepper, osmanthus, incense, pomarose, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, cedar, musk, patchouli",raw material glorious vanilla absolute madagascar smart thing let shine divine vanille perfumer olivi pescheux costly sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme addictively soft balmy darkly boozy amaretto tint topnote tease sense make want drink dulcettone nutmegspiced tonka bean paste dab place give vanilla luscious depth precious osmanthus absolute enhance naturally leathery aspect black woody vanilla pod tether dry slightly bitter smokiness texas cedar lush vanilla ring clear bell clever subtle arrangement note allow enjoy divine vanille several overlap layer delicious warmth pure vanilla dance around fruity suede turn reveal facet blond tobacco peach skin cinnamonduste wood wrap powdery bookpaperish resinousness benzoin diffusive musks divine vanille rare vanillacentere fragrance put vanilla front center without allow composition unravel plain white sugar sweetness gourmand let material drown delicate yet singular identity divine vanille mysterious yet easy read perfect balance simple complex
acqua di scandola eau de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Every single molecule in Acqua di Scandola reflects Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's love for Corsica and its wild, windswept beauty. Inspired by the eponymous Scandola, a tiny rocky outcrop of an island just off the Corsican coastline that can only be accessed by the sea, Acqua di Scandola is an unusual aquatic for two reasons. First, it conjures the natural scent of sea air without losing ground to the sweet, melony aromachemicals that ruin other aquatics. Second, Acqua di Scandola encapsulates not only the sea surrounding the island, but also the wild herbs, algae, aromatics, and grasses that cling to the rocks of the island itself.   We don't see it listed in the notes, but we smell a lot of citrus in the opening. In fact, it's as if Marc-Antoine Corticchiato borrowed the thrillingly bitter orange note from Azemour Les Orangers or the yuzu from Yuzu Fou, rubbed enough sea salt into its peel to make it crackle, and simply set it into a bed of algae, moss, and lichen. This citrus-in-a-sea-breeze accord is both natural-smelling and durable, occupying most of the scent's trajectory from top to bottom. But in the background, a textured mÃ©lange of garrigue herbs and grasses adds subtle warmth that reminds us of salt-kissed skin, hay, and minerals evaporating under the sun. Incredibly invigorating and lung-expanding, Acqua di Scandola is the rare aquatic that will really make you feel like you're on or near the sea itself, rather than in a chemical-driven fantasy of the real thing."," algae extract, juniper, immortelle, moss",every single molecule acqua di scandola reflect marcantoine corticchiatos love corsica wild windswept beauty inspire eponymous scandola tiny rocky outcrop island corsican coastline access sea acqua di scandola unusual aquatic two reason first conjure natural scent sea air without lose ground sweet melony aromachemical ruin aquatics second acqua di scandola encapsulates not sea surround island also wild herbs algae aromatics grass cling rock island not see list note smell lot citrus opening fact marcantoine corticchiato borrow thrillingly bitter orange note azemour les oranger yuzu yuzu fou rub enough sea salt peel make crackle simply set bed algae moss lichen citrusinaseabreeze accord naturalsmelle durable occupy scent trajectory top bottom background texture malange garrigue herbs grass add subtle warmth remind us saltkisse skin hay mineral evaporate sun incredibly invigorate lungexpande acqua di scandola rare aquatic really make feel like near sea rather chemicaldriven fantasy real thing
bee extrait de parfum,Zoologist," We don't usually play favorites. We love all of our perfumes, and their creators, equally. Trust us, we really do. But when a perfume comes along that's such a unanimous hit with Luckyscent staff, then we feel obliged to mention it. Bee is just irresistible! Opening with a luscious, jellied orange and a smattering of meadow flowers, the honey accord is both extremely realistic and un-animalic  a rare feat that makes Bee a real contender for the title of the baby bear's porridge of the honey fragrance genre. Set deep in a bombastic surround system of glittering amber and incense, the quietly golden floral honey center is magnified and broadcast until it fills the room, creating an incredible sillage that trails after you like the waves made by the Titanic. Though enormously rich and deep, the honey draws upon a doughy beeswax note to muffle its sweetness, and a softly musky, woody base of sandalwood and benzoin to keep it from sliding off into honey's more animalic facets. Honey is such a difficult note to do well  and, in our opinion, Bee is an unmitigated triumph. If you love, the honeyed, ambery warmth of scents such as Botrytis (but could do without the booze and grape must), then this gorgeous scent by Zoologist could be the Bee in your bonnet (sorry)."," orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musks, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",not usually play favorite love perfumes creator equally trust us really perfume come along unanimous hit luckyscent staff feel oblige mention bee irresistible opening luscious jellied orange smatter meadow flower honey accord extremely realistic unanimalic rare feat make bee real contender title baby bear porridge honey fragrance genre set deep bombastic surround system glitter amber incense quietly golden floral honey center magnified broadcast fills room create incredible sillage trail like wave make titanic though enormously rich deep honey draws upon doughy beeswax note muffle sweetness softly musky woody base sandalwood benzoin keep slide honeys animalic facet honey difficult note well opinion bee unmitigated triumph love honey ambery warmth scent botrytis could without booze grape must gorgeous scent zoologist could bee bonnet sorry

As a tribute to the unspoiled beauty of Madagascar, Majaina Sin doesn't stop at the vanilla, as the strikingly fiery supporting notes of ginger and cinnamon are also harvested from the island, infusing the smooth, sweet white floral heart with a jolt of passion and energy that balance the mouthwatering sugared orange, chestnut cream, and maple syrup.

meraki eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," Meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, Shisedo's long discontinued Nombre Noir. Envisioned as the Japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary Serge Lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to Shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. But a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than Luca Turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""When creating Meraki, Rasei Fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of Nombre Noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. However, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate Osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. It's a tribute to what Nombre Noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.And so this is the journey to Meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. Equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable Fort & Manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. It's a perfect Rasei Fort creation, in other words. And given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to Nombre Noir in every way."," Aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",meraki dark homage one infamous fragrance time shisedos long discontinue nombre noir envision japanese brand breakthrough western fragrance direction legendary serge lutens scent plagued cost overrun packaging complication ultimately run defective flacon lead shisedo pull plug destroy entire unsold stock bottle still osmanthusheavy scent shroud speculation mystery praise none luca turin epiphany perfect discontinue scent create meraki rasei fort certainly not attempt recreate scent nombre noir never dare open however base note endeavour create vintageinspire white floral heavily base around delicate osmanthus flower somewhat synonymous original tribute nombre noir represent passion sacrifice make perfumer unrelenting fervour create fragrance individualistic unique journey meraki gorgeous sumptuous blend sparkle aldehyde mouthwatere fruit delicately lush exquisite floral equal part vintage couture inimitable fort manle house style scent ravishingly seductive disarmingly wearable creation compelling influence sleeve perfect rasei fort creation word give extremely limited availability 300 bottle package exquisite wooden box available worldwide ever think worthy successor nombre noir every way
lust in paradise x reine paradis eau de parfum,Ex Nihilo," Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is the result of a special collaboration between Ex Nihilo Paris and the French-born visual artist Reine Paradis, who creates narrative photographs and paintings staging herself as the central figure in a transcendent landscape. Reine's work is characterized by abstract swatches of sea blues, greens, and lush tropical colors that plunge the viewer into a semi dream-like state  and this aesthetic has spilled over wholesale into Reine's gorgeous edit' of Lust in Paradise.Thus, if the original Lust in Paradise is a voyage to the French Riviera by way of a blissful dream, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is a journey to California by way of a Gaugin-esque painting of Tahiti. The original scent's pretty white peony and dewy, fruity lychee gains a new solar dimension by way of the addition of salty, woody ambergris note that creates the impression of sun-warmed skin. Giving the fruit, pink pepper, and pretty florals of the original an expansive, glittering radiance, the ambergris slowly melts down into a sultry woody base that  thanks to the woody-spicy molecule known as Georgywood  adds an even more substantial depth to the original's musky basenotes. Just as pretty and sparkling as the original, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis adds a special something that makes us dream of far-off islands, hypnotic seascapes, sun-drenched skin, and the laid-back feel of Californian artist colonies in California."," pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, Georgywood, ambergris accord",lust paradise x reine paradis result special collaboration ex nihilo paris frenchborn visual artist reine paradis create narrative photograph painting staging central figure transcendent landscape reine work characterize abstract swatch sea blue greens lush tropical color plunge viewer semi dreamlike state aesthetic spill wholesale reine gorgeous edit lust paradise thus original lust paradise voyage french riviera way blissful dream lust paradise x reine paradis journey california way gauginesque painting tahiti original scent pretty white peony dewy fruity lychee gain new solar dimension way addition salty woody ambergris note create impression sunwarmed skin give fruit pink pepper pretty floral original expansive glitter radiance ambergris slowly melt sultry woody base thanks woodyspicy molecule know georgywood add even substantial depth original musky basenote pretty sparkle original lust paradise x reine paradis add special something make us dream faroff island hypnotic seascapes sundrenched skin laidback feel californian artist colony california

atlas fever eau de parfum,Ex Nihilo," Inspired by the intoxicatingly woody, incensey scent of the greatest vintage rosewood guitars in history, Atlas Fever combines French niche perfumery know-how with the devil-may-care spirit of rebellion that defines rock n' roll.

le pavillon d'or eau de parfum,Dusita," Le Pavillon D'Or by Parfums Dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for Thai-born perfumer, Pissara Umavijani. First and foremost, it draws on the Sun Moon lake in Taiwan, where her father, the poet Montri Umavijani (1941-2006), wroteA Wish, a poem that reads:Will I ever have a chance/to sleep by the River of Love/look on the mountain of Long Life/and dip my vision in Sun Moon Lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinement. But Pissara was also inspired by her love for GuerlÃ©dan Lake in Brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the Aisawan Triphya-Art pavilion in Thailand, a stupendous piece of Thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. Regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of Le Pavillon d'Or. Le Pavillon d'Or is constructed as intricately as a Thai floating pavilion itself. Opening with the crisp, green chill of orris root and mint, the perfume feels immediately cooling; a hot brow soothed by splashes from a mountain stream. The peppery, citrusy nuances of the wild mentha citrata give the opening a fresh, almost classical feel. Soon after, an astonishing fig leaf accord moves into place, managing somehow to be both juicy and dry at the same time. Notes of sweet honeysuckle, boronia, white thyme, and Somalian frankincense render the fig leaf far more interesting than it oughtta be, with tendrils of sweet florals, smoky, and resinous herbal accents creating a heady-but-light whorl of scent. Underneath this all, a divine sandalwood dressed up with a complex, 30-note heliotrope accord give the scent a luxuriantly creamy, almondy base to bed it all down. Both aromatic and warm, Le Pavillon d'Or is a clever series of contrasts wrapped up in a bottle. We think it's as delicately beautiful as the trio of lakes that inspired it."," Mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",le pavillon dor parfum dusita inspire three different lake bear special meaning thaiborn perfumer pissara umavijani first foremost draws sun moon lake taiwan father poet montri umavijani 19412006 wrotea wish poem readswill ever chance sleep river love look mountain long life dip vision sun moon lake able live happily confinement pissara also inspire love guerladan lake brittany place vacation utter tranquility quiet well aisawan triphyaart pavilion thailand stupendous piece thai architecture seem float weightlessly several foot water palace lake regardless geography however sense calm emotive beauty common lake pervade bone le pavillon dor le pavillon dor construct intricately thai float pavilion opening crisp green chill orris root mint perfume feel immediately cool hot brow soothe splash mountain stream peppery citrusy nuance wild mentha citrata give opening fresh almost classical feel soon astonishing fig leaf accord move place manage somehow juicy dry time note sweet honeysuckle boronia white thyme somalian frankincense render fig leaf far interesting oughtta tendril sweet floral smoky resinous herbal accent create headybutlight whorl scent underneath divine sandalwood dress complex 30note heliotrope accord give scent luxuriantly creamy almondy base bed aromatic warm le pavillon dor clever series contrast wrap bottle think delicately beautiful trio lake inspire
les annees 25 bis eau de parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Les Annees 25 Bis is an exuberant throwback to what Andy Tauer refers to as the golden age of perfumery- 1920's Europe.

corpse reviver eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," In 2016, Bruno Fazzolari and Bogue's Antonio Gardoni released Cadavre Exquis, a playful and exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents through a sort of olfactory game of telephone. Featuring a striking dark chocolate note atop vintage-feeling aromatic florals, boozy fruit, and a potent dose of animalics, it was a monster of a scent- one that challenged- and rewarded- those off-kilter enough to get on its level. Now, with Corpse Reviver, Bruno Fazzolari has brought the spirit of Cadavre Exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together. And we must confess, it works perfectly- now, the rich, earthy indulgence of the dark chocolate springs more naturally from the juicy, boozy opening, while the animalics and spicy florals recede slightly in favor of the aromatics, allowing the composition to breathe and evolve.

elysium parfum cologne,Roja Parfums," Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is the original Elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. Forming part of Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long.  The original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the Parfum Cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. Joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. The fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the Cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. Towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. This Parfum Cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. If you'd like Aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder Bleu de Chanel, then step into the glorious Elysian Fields that is the Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne experience."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",elysium pour homme parfum cologne original elysium extrait linen summer suit eau de colognesoake kerchief tucked shirt pocket form part roja dove parfum cologne collection new category invent roja dove give client luxuriousness edp concentration 15 20 freshness eau de cologne elysium pour homme parfum cologne pure summer bliss bottle bathing wearer cloud sparkle sunlit citrus vetiver last day long original topsyturvy structure balmy musks follow fresh fruit invert parfum cologne iteration joyful opening volley grapefruit bergamot lime follow scintillate vetiver sparkle brightly citrus fruit join aromatic ginandtonic note juniper berry lemon peel smell like first good sip cold drink wearyingly hot day fruitiness apple blackcurrant heart note toned slightly cologne concentration rely slightly drier combination citrusy vetiver airy musks keep scent buoyant towards end balmy decidedly light creaminess creeps happy result benzoin vanilla mingle airy cloud musks ambergris yet elysium pour homme parfum cologne never lose crisp zestiness parfum cologne edition emphatically creature retain smooth luxuriousness make original extrait special would like aventus without smoky pineapple polished rounder bleu de chanel step glorious elysian field elysium pour homme parfum cologne experience
creation-e parfum cologne,Roja Parfums," Roja's much loved Creation-E, or Enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of London's Saville Row tailors. But maybe  just maybe  you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though Roja would probably argue with us on that one). If you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart  Roja Dove has heard you. Creation-E Parfum Cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather.  The warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. You still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but Creation-E Parfum Cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. Both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!"," bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de Grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",rojas much love creatione enigma know pond probably neplusultra private men club genre heady swirl cognac rum cane sugar cigar tobacco vanilla gingery aromas wraps around wearer like ermine cloak custommade one london saville row tailor maybe maybe not wear ermine cloak scent every day though roja would probably argue us one love rich warmth spicy oriental not know quit take heart roja dove hear creatione parfum cologne much light fresher take original eau de parfum perfect early office meeting stupid hot weather warm booziness cognac rum still cast frame feature light fresher quality wood tobacco jasmine get less rumandcoke feel not really appropriate outside date night deep winter lightlyspice powder tobacco affair still get complexity jasmine layered wood spice leather wood creatione parfum cologne airy genoise fruitcake original iteration gorgeous choose accord lifestyle personality
danger parfum cologne,Roja Parfums," A super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougÃ¨re with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, Danger Pour Homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via Roja Dove's  ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new Parfum Cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. This alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. Certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics  lavender, tarragon, and bergamot  and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",supercomplex aromatic barbershop fouga classically masculine ballast cedarwood patchouli oakmoss background support danger pour homme eau de parfum translate light fresher form via roja dove parfum cologne collection new category invent roja dove give client luxuriousness edp concentration 15 20 freshness eau de cologne danger pour homme parfum cologne deeply aromatic savoryherbalsoapy predecessor nose new parfum cologne iteration replace much eau de parfum earthy moss patchouli basenote beautifully hazy diffuse cedarwood blow radiant cloud ambergris musk alteration turn classic mature tailor eau de parfum something altogether young sensual certainly find combination tart aromatics lavender tarragon bergamot creamy musks tonka bean cedarwood surprisingly sexy danger pour homme parfum cologne retain impeccable bone structure original loosen knot tie expose invite glimpse warm tan flesh
scandal parfum cologne,Roja Parfums," If the original Scandal pour Homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougÃ¨re on steroids (think Eau Sauvage to the nth degree), then the Parfum Cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. Through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately  the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. The original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the Parfum Cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.  But make no bones about it  the brighter cologne'-like freshness does not mean a drop in performance metrics. Operating at an eau de parfum concentration of 20%, Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne is still a rich, solidly classical fougÃ¨re that will keep you smelling like a Belgravia Square gentleman through to the end of the day. If you love the minty, herbal freshness of traditional barbershop scents and deplore the sweetness of modern masculines, then you'll love Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne's return to form."," lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, spearmint, lavender, basil, tarragon, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, cardamom, clove, nutmeg, moss, patchouli, vetiver, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, labdanum, ambergris, musk",original scandal pour homme eau de parfum aromatic fouga steroid think eau sauvage nth degree parfum cologne version light relaxed take still incredibly masculine classicsmelle additional space air introduce structure allow us smell aromatic note clearly separately spearmint smell freshlyplucked stalky rhubarb note distinct petitgrain even searingly bitter original extrait coumarinrich finish lighten parfum cologne iteration herbal tarragon moss note get sing forestgreen song much long notice drydown also fresher sweeter tonka labdanum note dial back favor salty ambergris radiant musks make no bone bright colognelike freshness not mean drop performance metric operate eau de parfum concentration 20 scandal pour homme parfum cologne still rich solidly classical fouga keep smell like belgravia square gentleman end day love minty herbal freshness traditional barbershop scent deplore sweetness modern masculine love scandal pour homme parfum cologne return form
vetiver parfum cologne,Roja Parfums," With its new iteration as a Parfum Cologne - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne  Roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his Vetiver par excellence. Indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of Vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. But Vetiver Parfum Cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. Its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. Let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. Choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. Or maybe don't choose at all -  get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! In other words, worry not. What we love the most about Roja's vetiver  its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness  has been transposed wholesale here into the Parfum Cologne."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",new iteration parfum cologne new category invent roja dove give client luxuriousness edp concentration 15 20 freshness eau de cologne roja prof nothing market today come close sheer purity quality vetiver par excellence indeed rather relieved report iteration vetiver close character genredefine eau de parfum especially focus bright sparkle quality vetiver ofttimes danker rootier aspect vetiver parfum cologne indubitably light fresher feel exquisite balance wood citrus grassynutty vetiver bear aloft raft expansively radiant musks cedarwood lemongrassy litsea cubeba even footforward eau de parfum let us call summerweight twin original slightly cooler tone overall choose accord preference weight warmth density maybe not choose get vetiver need cover one neat impossibly elegant package word worry not love rojas vetiver brightness smoothassilk texture wholesome nuttiness lack discordant bitterness dankness transpose wholesale parfum cologne
la capitale parfum,Xerjoff," Refined and robust, La Capitale is a testament to Moscow in all of its glorious contradictions- the grandeur and grime, the charm and the chaos, the history and hipness- a true international metropolis. Any fragrance to do justice to this fascinating city must, of course, be as larger than life as the city itself, and so La Capitale bursts forth from the skin, a fruity, spicy, luscious, indulgent fragrance full of joy, zest, and the indomitable Russian spirit. On first spray, La Capitale is an explosively fruity, mouthwateringly sweet affair- caramel-dipped strawberries drip with sugared indulgence, while a juicy peach adds quenching refreshment. The heart of the fragrance ushers in a sophisticated and luxurious floral leather, reinforced with resinous labdanum, lush rose, and a beguilingly spicy blend of saffron and ginger. It all rests atop a wonderfully Xerjoff base of benzoin, amber, and vanilla, smooth, rich, and delectable.

spem petram eau de parfum,Olivier Durbano," ""Spem Petram,  "" which translates to ""Stone of Hope,  "" is a deeply personal fragrance for Olivier Durbano,   one that finds his religious,   spiritual,   and artistic impulses overlapping to create a deeply resonant,   biblically-inspired (the capital M's are a nod to Mary Magdalene,   who in French religious lore lived out her life in the forests of Southern France) scent of dark wood,   spicy resin,   and incense. At its core is a unique ingredient oft-referenced in the good book- nard,   an aromatic central Asian plant related to valerian root with a distinctively earthy,   salty,   mineralic quality. It's the perfect bridge between the other ingredients- smoky olibanum,   fiery cinnamon and saffron,   sharp,   bright fir,   and rich woods,   everything combining to build to an ecstatic crescendo tempered with an unexpectedly lush rose note. Together,   it creates a powerful sense of exotic spirituality- potent,   warm,   and soothing,   but with an otherworldly characteristic that never becomes overly familiar."," Olibanum, cinnamon, bay leaf, saffron, fir balsam, cabreuva, rose, nard, musk, cedar",spem petram translate stone hope deeply personal fragrance olivi durbano one find religious spiritual artistic impulse overlap create deeply resonant biblicallyinspire capital ms nod mary magdalene french religious lore live life forest southern france scent dark wood spicy resin incense core unique ingredient oftreferenced good book nard aromatic central asian plant relate valerian root distinctively earthy salty mineralic quality perfect bridge ingredient smoky olibanum fiery cinnamon saffron sharp bright fir rich wood everything combine build ecstatic crescendo temper unexpectedly lush rise note together create powerful sense exotic spirituality potent warm soothe otherworldly characteristic never become overly familiar
oud maximus autumn 19 extrait de parfum,Bortnikoff," What is real exoticism? This is something that you just couldn't try before. Today many people know what Oud is. But only a few know how rich and unusual can be the character of the wild Oud, fully revealed in a masterfully created blend. In Oud Maximus the concentration of Oud oils is so high that to preserve other notes, a special technique was created for mixing the Laotian, Indian and Thai Oud with four Rose oils from India, the Himalayas, Indonesia and France. The start of the fragrance is focused on the tantalizing animalistic character of the Oud from Laos, supported by Jasmine and Citruses. A voluminous accord of ambery Roses and Magnolia blossoms in the heart. The base consists of miscellaneous Oud oils, Civet and the Musk of Kabarga, which give the composition roundness and softness. This is how the precious fragrance maximally opening the heart of the wild Oud is born. No wonder, Oud Maximus is dedicated to the perfumer's son Maxim.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

vetiver nocturne autumn 19 extrait de parfum,Bortnikoff," If you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. This note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. Only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. This is especially true when it comes to the precious Indian 25-year-old vetiver oil Ruh Khus, which forms the heart of VÃ©tiver Nocturne. In order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young Ruh Khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. The base of the composition consists of the oils of Indonesian Sandalwood and Oud Trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of White Champaca and Thai Jasmine. Floral notes revealed the beauty of Sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old Sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. Only the real Mysore Sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. It's hard to imagine a better framing for the Vetiver note than this.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

female christ eau de parfum,19-69," On 29 May 1969, a naked woman carrying a cross walked through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange- an iconic piece of performance art carried out by Danish artists Lene Adler Petersen and BjÃ¸rn Norgaard that gripped the culture with its transgressive nature and exploration of religion, eroticism, and capitalism. However, as with so much of the genre-defying protest art of the '60s, only a photograph remains to commemorate the accomplishment.

atomic rose eau de parfum,Initio Parfums," If there's one thing Initio isn't known for, it's quiet fragrances- each release vibrates with an intense, sensual energy that's made the line an instant hit among stylish perfume lovers who want their signature scent to make a statement. Atomic Rose, their newest release, is another prime example of Initio's ability to find the harmonic balance between beauty and potency- a ravishingly sexy, invigoratingly unisex rose scent with liveliness and style to spare.

mizunara eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," A fragrance inspired by the distinct character of Japanese oak and beech trees spread over a rippling lake deep in the woods, Mizunara is an intriguingly complex combination of aquatic herbal notes and smoky woods that transport you to a hauntingly lovely and ancient forest tableau. At first spray, bright green galbanum fills the senses, like a fresh wind passing across the lake surface, carrying with it the scent of lily pads and pond algae, mixing with the invigorating wild herbs that grow on the ground below- rosemary and clary sage. A sharp lavender sparkles like the light reflecting onto the nearby beech leaves. As the distinctively Japanese wood notes emerge in strength- sharp and stout, with smoky tones- the second meaning of this fragrance emerges. Japanese wood, after all, makes up the barrels that give aged Japanese whiskey their distinctive flavor, and the wood here is cut with sweet, dry cognac oil to evoke the slightest hint of boozy malt beneath the patchouli and resins of Mizunara's base notes. The cumulative effect is one that should please liquor drinkers and nature enthusiasts alike- a fresh, bright, powerful woods scent, replete with uniquely Japanese character, deep and sophisticated enough for lovers of complex niche, but not without its easy-to-wear charm. In other words, a true fragrant journey the quality of which we've come to expect from the always exceptional Parfum Satori."," Galbanum, rosemary, clary sage, lavender, cognac oil, juniper, cypress, patchouli, blue chamomile, labdanum, tulu balsam, sandalwood",fragrance inspire distinct character japanese oak beech tree spread ripple lake deep wood mizunara intriguingly complex combination aquatic herbal note smoky wood transport hauntingly lovely ancient forest tableau first spray bright green galbanum fills sense like fresh wind pass across lake surface carry scent lily pad pond algae mix invigorate wild herbs grow ground rosemary clary sage sharp lavender sparkle like light reflect onto nearby beech leave distinctively japanese wood note emerge strength sharp stout smoky tone second meaning fragrance emerge japanese wood make barrel give aged japanese whiskey distinctive flavor wood cut sweet dry cognac oil evoke slight hint boozy malt beneath patchouli resin mizunaras base note cumulative effect one please liquor drinker nature enthusiast alike fresh bright powerful wood scent replete uniquely japanese character deep sophisticated enough lover complex niche not without easytowear charm word true fragrant journey quality come expect always exceptional parfum satori

radish x vetiver eau de parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash," Radish and Vetiver- two roots with wildly different profiles. Vetiver, a staple of perfumery, grassy and sweet, earthy and spicy- a complex, multifaceted and often quite masculine aroma. Radish, on the other hand, not typically considered a desirably fragrant material, capable of the pungent sharpness of natural gas, but beneath the surface, possessed of a distinctive greenness and subtle citric qualities as well. An odd combination on paper, undeniably, but in the hands of Comme des Garcons, one that feels quintessentially CDG- the spice and earth of the vetiver made both more intense by the radish's petroleum-like tones, while also softened and brightened with the green elements. A scent that feels both uniquely natural and unnatural all at once- a sexy, fresh, and dare we say cutting-edge fragrance that anyone can pull off with panache.

chloe sevigny little flower eau de parfum,Regime des Fleurs," From her beginning days as a 90's streetwear fashion icon and ""the coolest girl in the world"" to an award-winning career in film and television, ChloÃ« Sevigny is truly one of a kind- a star who follows her own creativity and places passion over profit. Naturally, we knew her signature fragrance would have to be more than a by-the-numbers celebuscent, but Little Flower is so much more than we could have expected- a disarmingly fresh, exuberantly sexy rose that feels youthful and provocative all at once. Little Flower is built around rose, Sevigny's favorite note, and it's a beautiful specimen - a precious Ottoman rose absolute, romantic and bright, with a compellingly fleshy carnality. This raw appeal is tempered with sweet honeysuckle and fresh peony, and enhanced with the complexity of gently smoky black tea and the aromatic fruitiness of blackcurrant.

baie 19 eau de parfum,Le Labo," Truth is...Baie 19 should have been called Water 19. Not that it smells like nothing (though nothing smells like it), but it has this crisp, wet, drenched effect that water gives to the earth after the rain...And there's a word for that, by the way: petrichor. It's that magical feeling during heavy rain after a long dry spell, and it's one of the most beautiful olfactive phenomena in nature. There are many reasons for this, including the ozone in the air, the negative ions, but most importantly the release of oil secretions from certain plants, accumulated after a long dry period. This is what Baie 19 is about: the dry juniper berry, the patchouli, the green leaves... all soaked by a beautiful, luminous, magnetic rain after a long drought. And the joy that comes with it...Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

across the ocean eau de parfum,Gravel," The story of Gravel is one that connects two continents- Europe and North America- so it's only appropriate that their second scent is a tribute to the invisible ties between the two, and the luxurious overseas steamer ships of yesteryear that used to ferry people of all walks of life to and from the old country. Across The Ocean is a robust scent of smooth, deep woods, rich oud, and luxurious musk that exudes the gentlemanly sophistication of a bygone era. Citrus adds a light, bright touch to the opening notes, while tonka, musk, and vanilla soften and sweeten the richness of the woodsy base. Conceived by Joseph Knudsen as a men's scent, we find it easily wearable by anyone who enjoys potent but balanced woodsiness- the kind of scent that signifies good taste and adventurous spirit, all without shouting."," Bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk",story gravel one connect two continent europe north america appropriate second scent tribute invisible tie two luxurious overseas steamer ship yesteryear use ferry people walk life old country across ocean robust scent smooth deep wood rich oud luxurious musk exude gentlemanly sophistication bygone era citrus add light bright touch opening note tonka musk vanilla soften sweeten richness woodsy base conceive joseph knudsen men scent find easily wearable anyone enjoy potent balance woodsiness kind scent signifie good taste adventurous spirit without shout
terrible teddy eau de parfum,Penhaligons," ""Teddy lives for the thrill of the chase, ensnaring unsuspecting hearts with his scent.""You can be forgiven if the plotlines of the Penhaligon's Portraits series have become a bit too convoluted to follow- to be honest, we're not quite sure we know what's going on at this point. Luckily, all that matters (aside from those jaw-dropping caps) is the scent, and Terrible Teddy is a robust, masculine, and surprisingly nuanced leather and incense gem. While the imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks to Teddy's impressive lasting power, there's refinement and subtlety at play here- the opening bursts with piquant spice, the leather is luxurious and supple, the incense delicately smoky with a perfectly metered dollop of dark woodsiness in the drydown, leavened with the warm airiness of ambroxan. With a secret weapon like this, it's no wonder Terrible Teddy has managed to ensnare so many unsuspecting hearts."," Incense, leather, ambroxan",teddy life thrill chase ensnare unsuspecting heart scent forgive plotline penhaligon portrait series become bit convoluted follow honest not quite sure know go point luckily matter aside jawdropping cap scent terrible teddy robust masculine surprisingly nuance leather incense gem impose golden rhinoceros certainly speak teddys impressive last power refinement subtlety play opening burst piquant spice leather luxurious supple incense delicately smoky perfectly meter dollop dark woodsiness drydown leaven warm airiness ambroxan secret weapon like no wonder terrible teddy manage ensnare many unsuspecting heart
heartless helen eau de parfum,Penhaligons," ""Who needs romance when one wields power?"" That's the tagline for Heartless Helen, which Penhaligon's tells us is the olfactory story of a fearless conquistadora, fresh off her latest conquest. But while we don't for a moment doubt that this fragrance, imbued with  seductively lively tuberose, could give anyone the power to steal and break a few hearts, we wouldn't be so quick to paint Helen as a villain. To us, her signature scent is not only deeply sensual but also joyful and vibrant, a bouquet of narcotic white florals freshened with bright, juicy mandarin to capture the imagination. A gently creamy, warm woodsiness (we detect facets of sandalwood, gaiac, and cedar) adds sophistication and depth to the drydown, but the star of the show- the gorgeous, intoxicating tuberose- lasts from beginning to end. Is Heartless Helen truly as wicked as they say? Perhaps with a scent this brightly beautiful, it doesn't matter much- we're already in too deep."," Mandarin orange, tuberose, creamy woods",need romance one wield power tagline heartless helen penhaligon tell us olfactory story fearless conquistadora fresh late conquest not moment doubt fragrance imbue seductively lively tuberose could give anyone power steal break heart would not quick paint helen villain us signature scent not deeply sensual also joyful vibrant bouquet narcotic white floral freshen bright juicy mandarin capture imagination gently creamy warm woodsiness detect facet sandalwood gaiac cedar add sophistication depth drydown star show gorgeous intoxicate tuberose last begin end heartless helen truly wicked say perhaps scent brightly beautiful not matter much already deep
plumeria de orris extrait de parfum,Areej Le Dore," This composition is dedicated to plumeria (known also as frangipani), the most gorgeous Asian flower. To find an extract that properly represents this flower is indeed a challenge. In Plumeria de Orris, we used nearly one kilogram of white frangipani extract that we believe captures the true nature of this exquisite blossom. We added a touch of genuine distilled plumeria oil, the rarest, most expensive floral essential oil we have ever encountered (at a price of over $200 per gram).Soft, powdery whispers of plumeria, full of narcotic, head-spinning, creamy floral notes, uplift the olfactory senses. Orris butter absolute further enhances its powdery splendor, making its floral soul even more expansive, deeper and longer lasting. A gentle touch of apricot, with its honeyed flesh and velvety suede skin, boosts the plumeria's fruity aspect. It adds juicy sweetness and an almost gourmand nuance to the top notes.Creamy floral notes slowly sink into buttery sandalwood. Wild aroma of civet adds a dash of animalic depth to the arrangement. Clouds of vanilla emerge from hiding behind the woods and deliver delicious olfactory joy.Dense and incensey myrrh embraces oriental notes. Rich and resinous, this time-honored ingredient blends perfectly with dark and sooty vetiver. Virginian cedarwood provides a smoky, woody texture that perfectly completes this lush, luxurious composition and creates a well-balanced earthy backbone.Plumeria, the floral soul of Asia, has been immersed in an apricot cocktail and magnified by oriental, incensey, animalic woods. Plumeria de Orris is a mesmerizing journey to Asia, a land that is both astonishingly wild and breathtakingly beautiful."," plumeria absolute, natural apricot accord and orris root absolute, sandalwood, vanilla and synthetic civet, myrrh, vetiver and cedarwood",composition dedicated plumeria know also frangipani gorgeous asian flower find extract properly represent flower indeed challenge plumeria de orris use nearly one kilogram white frangipani extract believe capture true nature exquisite blossom add touch genuine distil plumeria oil rare expensive floral essential oil ever encounter price 200 per gram soft powdery whisper plumeria full narcotic headspinne creamy floral note uplift olfactory sense orris butter absolute enhance powdery splendor make floral soul even expansive deeply long last gentle touch apricot honey flesh velvety suede skin boost plumerias fruity aspect add juicy sweetness almost gourmand nuance top note creamy floral note slowly sink buttery sandalwood wild aroma civet add dash animalic depth arrangement cloud vanilla emerge hide behind wood deliver delicious olfactory joy dense incensey myrrh embrace oriental note rich resinous timehonore ingredient blend perfectly dark sooty vetiver virginian cedarwood provide smoky woody texture perfectly complete lush luxurious composition create wellbalanced earthy backbone plumeria floral soul asia immerse apricot cocktail magnified oriental incensey animalic wood plumeria de orris mesmerize journey asia land astonishingly wild breathtakingly beautiful
love kills eau de parfum,Masque Milano," While the concept of a soliflore might suggest simpler, more linear scents, one sniff of Love Kills should quickly disavow you of that notion. Instead, Caroline Dumur has created a rose soliflore with luscious yet edgy depth, one that masterfully plays off of the well known phrase it takes its name from to present both the romantic and dangerous sides of the grand dame of perfume florals.On the ""Love"" side of things, the fragrance opens with joyful brightness, using a mouthwateringly juicy lychee note to introduce a sparkling, ambrette-tinted rose oxide. As it blossoms into a full-bodied, romantic Turkish rose absolute, we see the darker, more sensual, ""Killer"" side of the equation- sultrier floral tones, animalic musk, and a woodsy patchouli distillation with a decidedly...thorny quality. It's a portrait of love in full- the joy, the hope, the intensity, and even the heartbreak, all contained within the multifaceted beauty of a rose."," Lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk",concept soliflore may suggest simple linear scent one sniff love kill quickly disavow notion instead caroline dumur create rise soliflore luscious yet edgy depth one masterfully play well know phrase take name present romantic dangerous side grand dame perfume floral love side thing fragrance open joyful brightness use mouthwateringly juicy lychee note introduce sparkle ambrettetinte rise oxide blossom fullbodie romantic turkish rise absolute see darker sensual killer side equation sultrier floral tone animalic musk woodsy patchouli distillation decidedlythorny quality portrait love full joy hope intensity even heartbreak contain within multifacete beauty rise

suma oriental eau de parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Suma Oriental refers to the brilliant collection of writings by TomÃ© Pires, a Portugese apothecary who became ambassador to China in the 16th century. An intensely detailed description of an insular southeast Asia, Suma Oriental revealed for the first time that sandalwood originated in the Sumba, or modern day Indonesia.

A robust cocoa note adds sweet, earthy complexity, while a gaiac-forward base of smooth woods supplement the sandalwood's mouthwatering depth.

murmure des dieux eau de parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali the Spiritual, the island that wakes up slowly each day to the rhythm of offerings. This is a time when women gather freshly cut flowers to accompany their religious rituals. Bali's iconic flower is the 'Jepun', or frangipani.

bohemian soul eau de parfum,Une Nuit Nomade," In 1966 the documentary 'Endless Summer' was released, chronicling two American surfers' quest for the perfect wave. From the end of their surfboards, we experience the desire to push time zones further away so the summer never ends. This quest continues, with the entire planet becoming a refuge of immense beaches punctuated with hiding places where free spirits love to converge.Bohemian Soul is a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing fragrance that reflects this journey with elegance and modernity: the immediate freshness of artemisia, like a gentle wind rising up over the ocean, giving way to rooty iris and clean guaiac wood before the flourish of creamy sandalwood and the delicacy of soft, seductive musk entwine.

An androgynous perfume with notes of tobacco wrapped in patchouli leaves, pierced with a touch of vanilla. Smoky, spicy, mossy, and floral, with just the slightest hint of sweetness, it feels like it could be the smell of an iconically kitschy motel hallway, faded carpet and cigarette smoke, primally comforting, with seduction, adventure, relaxation, and beautiful mundanity hidden behind each subsequent door."," Bergamot, Iris, Incense, Carnation, Mosses, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tobacco, Leather",andy warhol move montauk become anchor point lighthouse entire generation artist rent mansion summer roll stone rehearsing tour prerecord would one great albums black blue include melancholy ballad memory motel eponymous perfume burn tribute restless turbulent time androgynous perfume note tobacco wrap patchouli leave pierce touch vanilla smoky spicy mossy floral slight hint sweetness feel like could smell iconically kitschy motel hallway fade carpet cigarette smoke primally comfort seduction adventure relaxation beautiful mundanity hide behind subsequent door

harem soiree parfum,Arte Profumi," A boozy rose dipped in honey and plunged into the salty rawness of ambergris, Harem Soiree is a stunning attar-like fragrance that takes no prisoners in the floral oriental genre. The ambergris lends a fiercely saline, windswept edge to the ambery underpinnings of the fragrance, joining with a resinous, licorice-like myrrh to render a picture of an unsweet, unpolished chunk of amber resin that has just washed up on a beach somewhere along the Baltic coast. The textural contrasts in Harem Soiree are incredibly satisfying, especially in the juxtaposition of the syrupy, honeyed rose against the rough-edged, salt-and-pepper dryness of the ambergris and myrrh notes. Rich in a mouthwateringly sweet-and-savory way that keeps you interested all day long, Harem Soiree has the additional advantage of being hugely radiant and sillage-aceous - outwitting humidity, showers, or whatever else you can throw at it. To wear Harem Soiree is to be bathed in your own personal halo of roses, precious resins, and salty ambergris, saturating the air around you in a heavy rose-gold hue.

velvet rouge,Arte Profumi," Velvet Rouge is not for a perfume for wallflowers. Immediately enveloping and rich, it lustfully embraces the bold statement that only coffee beans, licorice, and cacao pods can make when exposed to high heat  a delightfully aromatic, burnt aroma that fans of both Borneo 1838 by Serge Lutens and Coze by Parfumerie Generale will adore. Despite its cocoa-dusted opening, however, Velvet Rouge steers well away from the gourmand elements of its dark materials, choosing instead to chase the cocoa down with a hit of bright, spicy chili pepper and a dusting of nutmeg. With a rooty, slightly dirty-grungy vetiver and what smells to us like a ton of sooty frankincense bringing up the rear instead of the usual vanilla or amber, Velvet Noir retains its slightly austere, mysterious character throughout. It finishes out on an unusual accent of smoked-out licorice. A scent full of shadows and secrets, Velvet Rouge is perfect for those of few words and un-guessed-at depths."," cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice",velvet rouge not perfume wallflower immediately envelop rich lustfully embrace bold statement coffee bean licorice cacao pod make expose high heat delightfully aromatic burn aroma fan borneo 1838 serge lutens coze parfumerie generale adore despite cocoadusted opening however velvet rouge steer well away gourmand element dark material choose instead chase cocoa hit bright spicy chili pepper dusting nutmeg rooty slightly dirtygrungy vetiver smell us like ton sooty frankincense bring rear instead usual vanilla amber velvet noir retain slightly austere mysterious character throughout finish unusual accent smokedout licorice scent full shadow secret velvet rouge perfect word unguessedat depth
bois sacre parfum,Arte Profumi," Bois Sacre, or sacred wood, is an artistic rendering of the yin and yang character of two of the most precious woods in the world, namely Indian oud and sandalwood. Cleverly playing the animalic, leathery sourness of Indian oud off against the buttery, aromatic dryness of Indian sandalwood, the result is a scent that is exuberantly rich and full-flavored but not in the slightest bit heavy. The medley of woods here seems to shimmer in the air like the red dust over a North African desert. If the woods are remarkably airy, the doughy, treacly resinousness of labdanum moves quickly into place underneath to ground them. Growing ever drier and leatherier over time, we love how the labdanum lends an earthy, resinous heft that acts as a center of balance for the scent without ever drowning the woods in the buttery sweetness of vanilla. There's even a dusty hot paper' note in the drydown that makes us think of benzoin, even though none is listed. Dry but rich, this is the perfect woody oriental for cold weather."," agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum",bois sacre sacred wood artistic rendering yin yang character two precious wood world namely indian oud sandalwood cleverly play animalic leathery sourness indian oud buttery aromatic dryness indian sandalwood result scent exuberantly rich fullflavored not slight bit heavy medley wood seem shimmer air like red dust north african desert wood remarkably airy doughy treacly resinousness labdanum move quickly place underneath ground grow ever drier leatherier time love labdanum lend earthy resinous heft act center balance scent without ever drown wood buttery sweetness vanilla even dusty hot paper note drydown make us think benzoin even though none list dry rich perfect woody oriental cold weather
samharam parfum,Arte Profumi," Samharam is a rich incense scent that traces a straight line to the ancient aromas of myrrh and benzoin that would have accompanied the caravan traders that moved from across the deserts from the spice and resin markets of Somalia and Oman to Venice and beyond. Opening with a triumphantly coca cola-ish myrrh with smoky licorice overtones, Samharam rolls on like a stone, picking up the deeply sooty nuances of Somali frankincense and elemi, as well as the sweeter hot brown paper' powderiness of benzoin. Samharam smells both sacred and profane, the ethereal High Church' lift of the incense raising our thoughts up to the heavens, while all the time enticing our more gustatory senses with a pleasing bite of black pepper and a slightly salty amber. Although not foody in the slightest, there's something piquant in this incense accord that pricks the saliva glands and makes our bellies growl. Incredibly full-figured and rich, as all Arte Profumi fragrances are, Samharam is the old world Italian artisanal response to the thin and bony incense scents of modern lore."," myrrh, incense, benzoin",samharam rich incense scent trace straight line ancient aromas myrrh benzoin would accompany caravan trader move across desert spice resin market somalia oman venice beyond opening triumphantly coca colaish myrrh smoky licorice overtone samharam roll like stone pick deeply sooty nuance somali frankincense elemi well sweeter hot brown paper powderiness benzoin samharam smell sacred profane ethereal high church lift incense raise thought heavens time entice gustatory sense pleasing bite black pepper slightly salty amber although not foody slight something piquant incense accord prick saliva gland make belly growl incredibly fullfigure rich arte profumi fragrance samharam old world italian artisanal response thin bony incense scent modern lore
sucre noir parfum,Arte Profumi," Sucre Noir deserves the same Holy Grail status granted by vanilla lovers to Tihota by Indult or Vaniglia by Mazzolari. One of the most luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled, it is the olfactory equivalent of being wrapped up in the purest, whitest' cashmere blanket that costs  more than most of us earn in a month. There's a luxury in its simplicity, because there's nowhere for any mistakes to hide. Recalling nothing more than the nostalgic goodness of white sugar infused with the sultry warmth of a vanilla bean or two, and perhaps a breath of cocoa-dusted vanilla orchid, it is the sort of  vanilla we loved first while learning about taste and smell  that pure white' sort of sweetness as of yet unsullied by smoke, musk, or resin. The cane sugar is the perfect final touch, its slightly burnt, brown sugar aroma adding an interesting caramelization that creates depth but not shade. Vanilla lovers  we are putting you on notice!"," orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane",sucre noir deserve holy grail status grant vanilla lover tihota indult vaniglia mazzolari one luxurious vanilla scent ever smell olfactory equivalent wrap pure white cashmere blanket cost us earn month luxury simplicity nowhere mistake hide recall nothing nostalgic goodness white sugar infuse sultry warmth vanilla bean two perhaps breath cocoadusted vanilla orchid sort vanilla love first learn taste smell pure white sort sweetness yet unsullied smoke musk resin cane sugar perfect final touch slightly burn brown sugar aroma add interesting caramelization create depth not shade vanilla lover put notice
oeilleres parfum extrait,Roberto Greco,"I want to echo the flowers I photograph without referring to any one in particular. Therefore, along with Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, we decided to exclude rose, jasmine and all the overly tangible flowers. We managed to express the general idea of floralcy through the dried flower, pollen and honey facets of chamomile and broom. To connect the scent with the figures I photograph, I also wanted to convey the feel of flesh. In order to achieve this, we brought out the animal aspects of vegetal notes, as well as various spices and resins.  Though it wasn't an end in itself, the fragrance is bursting with natural ingredients  sometimes in very high doses, all the better to express the organic duality of my images.

slow dance eau de parfum,BYREDO," The slow dance: a rite of passage for girls and boys before they metamorphose into women and men. A feeling of exhilaration tempered, or perhaps heightened, by awkwardness. A heady collision of innocence and experience, knowing and not knowing, felt universally across countries, cultures, and time. Slow Dance: a scent that evokes these collective memories and experiences in a unisex oriental amber, bitter and sweet, intoxicating and youthful. A top note of sweet myrrh provides an immediate honeyed, smoky sensuality against a heart of creamy, ambery labdanum and sparkling fresh geranium. All is swathed in a magical veil of violet, while a base of vanilla and patchouli anchor the amber notes, a contrast between sweet and earthy, mouthwatering and mysterious, that brings our minds back to school gymnasiums and stolen kisses.

la couche du diable eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," La Couche du Diable (we'll choose to forego some of the raunchier translations and simply call it ""The Devil's Bed"") was bound to cause a fuss- after all, throughout his many releases, Serge Lutens has never before featured oud in a fragrance. But with that in mind, don't expect anything resembling a typical oud scent. Oh, there's an unmistakably high-quality oud in here- darkly woodsy, warm, and sweetly balsamic- but its more challengingly animalic tones are, if not subverted, at least channeled into resinous cistus and syrupy fruit-and-rose combination that incite a sense of deep, seductive comfort. Serge Lutens' own copy describes La Couche du Diable as ""a diabolical and sumptuous veil of indulgence and remorse for a first transgression."" We'd agree, up to a certain point- but if we're being honest, when it comes to this stunning fragrance- remorse doesn't even cross our mind."," Oud accord, cistus jam, fruity complex, rose",la couche du diable choose forego raunchier translation simply call devils bed bound cause fuss throughout many release serge lutens never feature oud fragrance mind not expect anything resemble typical oud scent oh unmistakably highquality oud darkly woodsy warm sweetly balsamic challengingly animalic tone not subvert least channel resinous cistus syrupy fruitandrose combination incite sense deep seductive comfort serge lutens copy describe la couche du diable diabolical sumptuous veil indulgence remorse first transgression would agree certain point honest come stunning fragrance remorse not even cross mind

This breathtaking natural beauty is the inspiration for Patricia and Axel de Nicolai's newest leather scent, a robust yet velvet-soft offering that eschews the garishness of brutal, flashy leathers for the smoothness of freshly-tanned suede, placed expertly in the midst of the crisp and invigorating scents of a wild Siberian birch forest. The leather aspect of this EDP is essentially created by blending two dry, woody notes: essence of gaiac wood and essence of smoked pine. This powerful duet is revealed by a fiery start of spicy citrus with yuzu, pepper and saffron, while the aromatic touch of spearmint completes the top note. The floral heart of rose and violet envelops the leather, softened by an iris butter, tonka beans and white musk background.

squid extrait de parfum,Zoologist," The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges.

kintsugi eau de parfum,Masque Milano," ""Cherish the simple. Cherish the old. Do not hide your scars, show them with pride.""This simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures the ethos behind the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, or Kintsukuroi, which repairs broken pottery using gold-infused lacquer, highlighting instead of obfuscating the cracks and celebrating the beauty and strength of imperfection. With this as inspiration, Masque Milano and perfumer Vanina Muracciole delivers a ""rediscovered"" chypre, pieced back together with a golden vein of suede leather that both restores and reimagines the structure of the style. Traditional elements of bright, bracing bergamot and rich, refined patchouli remain, but oakmoss has been replaced with a salty, savory amber accord that complements the glowing suede heart with an unmistakable fine-grain shimmer. A lovely touch of femininity comes by way of fresh, elegant Grasse rose centifolia and watery magnolia, while the aforementioned patchouli- fractionally distilled to strip away the mustiest aspects- rebalances the composition to sophisticated, unisex bliss. Whether you're a chypre lover looking for a loving reinterpretation, or simply a fan of Masque Milano's elegant yet unpretentious, creator-driven fragrances, Kintsugi is every bit the sparkling treasure its name makes it out to be."," Bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla",cherish simple cherish old not hide scar show pride simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly capture ethos behind ancient japanese technique kintsugi kintsukuroi repair break pottery use goldinfuse lacquer highlight instead obfuscate crack celebrate beauty strength imperfection inspiration masque milano perfumer vanina muracciole deliver rediscover chypre pieced back together golden vein suede leather restore reimagines structure style traditional element bright brace bergamot rich refined patchouli remain oakmoss replace salty savory amber accord complement glow suede heart unmistakable finegrain shimmer lovely touch femininity come way fresh elegant grasse rise centifolia watery magnolia aforementioned patchouli fractionally distil strip away mustiest aspect rebalance composition sophisticated unisex bliss whether chypre lover look love reinterpretation simply fan masque milanos elegant yet unpretentious creatordriven fragrance kintsugi every bit sparkle treasure name make

ta'if elixir parfum,Ormonde Jayne," The Ta'if rose- greener, spicier, more vibrant than the lusher European varietals- was the perfect centerpiece to the original Ta'if EDP, where sweet spice and gentle, watery florals defined a light, elegant rose scent with a restrained touch of gourmand exoticism. In Elixir form, however, a dramatic new element emerges with the addition of precious Cambodian oudh, which introduces a rich, warm, animalic sensuality. While it'd be hard to argue that this doesn't add some heaviness to a previously lighter-than-air composition, we urge you to think of Ta'if Elixir as its own, separate fragrance- one where the oudh turns the peppery florals into something sweepingly romantic and thoroughly, three-dimensionally gorgeous. Ta'if Elixir is a scent to be worn with reckless abandon, a breathtaking perfume of tremendous presence and timeless elegance. What We Think Quite different from the airy, subtle Ta'if EDP, and miles apart from a typical rose-oud combination as well. Deep, rich, and authentically warm and animalic."," Pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oudh",taif rise greener spicy vibrant lusher european varietal perfect centerpiece original taif edp sweet spice gentle watery floral define light elegant rise scent restrain touch gourmand exoticism elixir form however dramatic new element emerge addition precious cambodian oudh introduce rich warm animalic sensuality would hard argue not add heaviness previously lighterthanair composition urge think taif elixir separate fragrance one oudh turn peppery floral something sweepingly romantic thoroughly threedimensionally gorgeous taif elixir scent wear reckless abandon breathtake perfume tremendous presence timeless elegance think quite different airy subtle taif edp miles apart typical roseoud combination well deep rich authentically warm animalic
royal elixir parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum was, and is, a head-turner. From the surprisingly bright green and citrus opening to the sweet and spicy florals, it was a decidedly new kind of amber scent- all of the dreamy indulgence of amber, but none of the heaviness. Royal Elixir doesn't mess with a perfect thing, and so the key notes of Ambre Royal are unaltered- bergamot, jasmine, amber, patchouli. And yet, when concentrated to parfum strength for the Elixir, new heights of complexity are reached- sweet, fresh, warm, and powdery elements intertwine with hypnotic power. And just like that, one of our all time favorite amber scents gets even more unique. What We Think Like the original Ambre Royal, a sophisticated, elegant floral amber- the Elixir concentration brings out the full lushness of the romantic florals and the powdered richness of the tonka and patchouli."," Green notes, orange, bergamot, jasmine, rose, amber, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",ambre royal eau de parfum headturner surprisingly bright green citrus opening sweet spicy floral decidedly new kind amber scent dreamy indulgence amber none heaviness royal elixir not mess perfect thing key note ambre royal unaltered bergamot jasmine amber patchouli yet concentrated parfum strength elixir new heights complexity reach sweet fresh warm powdery element intertwine hypnotic power like one time favorite amber scent get even unique think like original ambre royal sophisticated elegant floral amber elixir concentration bring full lushness romantic floral powder richness tonka patchouli

gentle fluidity silver eau de parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Gentle fluidity  note the small f  is part of perfumer Francis Kurkdjian's experiment to see what happens when you set out with an identical set of notes but head off in two separate directions. The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver)  that prove that a painter's palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the master's art  one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the fresher of this charming duo. Immediately, the fresh gin-and-tonic fizz of juniper berry dominates, followed closely by a spiced woody note that's not quite as sharp as pine but still redolent of the cool, aromatic aroma of a coniferous forest. The coriander lends a metallic, peppery sheen to the woods that lifts the ashy greenness of the traditional fougÃ¨re-like accord in the heart and modernizes it for the young professional we see this fitting to a T. Crisp, fresh, and with a certain champagne-like sparkle that connects the dots to its warmer, richer Gold counterpart, Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the kind of scent you can dress up with a white shirt and tie, or dress down in khakis, and it will never be less than perfect."," Juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",gentle fluidity note small f part perfumer francis kurkdjians experiment see happen set identical set note head two separate direction result complementary utterly different pair fragrance gentle fluidity gold gentle fluidity silver prove painter palette start point magic happen painter pick brush two distinct form emerge master art one one share dna gentle fluidity silver fresher charming duo immediately fresh ginandtonic fizz juniper berry dominate follow closely spice woody note not quite sharp pine still redolent cool aromatic aroma coniferous forest coriander lend metallic peppery sheen wood lift ashy greenness traditional fouga relike accord heart modernize young professional see fitting crisp fresh certain champagnelike sparkle connect dot warm rich gold counterpart gentle fluidity silver kind scent dress white shirt tie dress khakis never less perfect

musk cologne eau de parfum,Bortnikoff," When you have access to raw materials as exceptionally high quality as those used in Bortnikoff scents, the word ""cologne"" should never be mistaken to mean a fragrance is light or fleeting.

a man's cologne eau de parfum,Gravel," There are fragrances that are defined by their era, and then there are fragrances that outlast their own era and become immortal. Gravel is just such a fragrance. Originally invented by Michael Knudsen in 1957, Gravel A Man's Cologne was a different sort of men's scent right from the start- sold exclusively at select boutiques and featuring a distinctive profile- fresh, fruity citrus that transitions into a never-too-heavy blend of balsamic woody notes. The base blends powdery tonka, a secret selection of spices, and a mineralic, lightly industrial aura of incense and vetiver that does indeed call to mind the name of the fragrance- and yes, those are real pieces of gravel in the bottle, perhaps imbuing their own unique character over time. The result is a scent that we'd imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago. Gravel A Man's Cologne is, by any standard, a legendary scent. Who couldn't use one of those in their life?"," Bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk",fragrance define era fragrance outlast era become immortal gravel fragrance originally invent michael knudsen 1957 gravel mans cologne different sort men scent right start sell exclusively select boutique feature distinctive profile fresh fruity citrus transition nevertooheavy blend balsamic woody note base blend powdery tonka secret selection spice mineralic lightly industrial aura incense vetiver indeed call mind name fragrance yes real piece gravel bottle perhaps imbue unique character time result scent would imagine exact balance elegant classicism sexy modernity 2019 half century ago gravel mans cologne standard legendary scent could not use one life
villa nellcote eau de parfum,19-69," ""Never has a house been so closely associated with the creation of a rock album. This was a summer that would change the history of music forever. The fragrance Villa Nellcote is the embodiment of the magnificent garden and surroundings at the estate with the same name."" -Johan Bergelin Villa Nellcote, a 19th-century mansion overlooking Villefranche Bay on France's Cote d'Azur, has what could generously be called a colorful past- after serving as a Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of France, the Villa was reclaimed for ""allied"" debauchery when it was famously rented in the summer of 1971 to serve as the party palace and studio of the Rolling Stones as they recorded their classic album Exile On Main Street. Using the lushly landscaped grounds as an inspiration, Villa Nellcote the fragrance is a smooth, confident unisex floral, boasting a bouquet of lush flowers enriched with a piquant blend of fresh green citrus and spice. We picture ourselves atop the grand outdoor staircase overlooking the lavish gardens, with a subtly smoky base of black tea, patchouli and woods the only indication of the rock-star hedonism happening in the cellar-turned-studio, hidden away from prying eyes. For those who like their summertime freshness with just a hint of naughtiness, Villa Nellcote is a perfect tribute to a locale that will forever live in rock-n-roll infamy."," Grapefruit, bergamot, petitgrain, pink pepper, elemi, lemon, lemon flower, violet, rose, jasmine, magnolia, osmanthus, black tea, cabreuva, cedar, patchouli, white amber, musk, moss, gaiac",never house closely associated creation rock album summer would change history music forever fragrance villa nellcote embodiment magnificent garden surrounding estate name johan bergelin villa nellcote 19thcentury mansion overlook villefranche bay france cote dazur could generously call colorful past serve gestapo headquarters nazi occupation france villa reclaim allied debauchery famously rent summer 1971 serve party palace studio roll stone record classic album exile main street use lushly landscape ground inspiration villa nellcote fragrance smooth confident unisex floral boasting bouquet lush flower enrich piquant blend fresh green citrus spice picture atop grand outdoor staircase overlook lavish gardens subtly smoky base black tea patchouli wood indication rockstar hedonism happen cellarturnedstudio hide away prying eye like summertime freshness hint naughtiness villa nellcote perfect tribute locale forever live rocknroll infamy
portrayal man eau de parfum,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to himself. A reflection of his unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's.

portrayal woman,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to herself. A reflection of her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional. Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Portrayal Woman is for the poised and playfully refined woman who dares to defy. With a smoky yet sweet mÃ©lange created by the fusion of Craven A' Tobacco with a dusting of Vanilla, this scent is brought together with Jasmine at its top, Elemi at its base and heartened with Tuberose, recreating the 1920's liberation movement."," Jasmine, Vanilla, Tabacco, Tuberose",fifth chapter cycle amouage narrative portrayal manifestation person orientation reflection unique authenticity break free cage solitude society set around people truth often see shockingly unconventional portrayal embodie artist ability reconnect fragment different time place society barren able transport immerse freedom rebellion compare london roar 1920s new yorks groove 1980s flamboyant glamorous often disaffect companionship bright young people artist lose portrayal woman poise playfully refined woman dare defy smoky yet sweet malange create fusion craven tobacco dusting vanilla scent bring together jasmine top elemi base hearten tuberose recreate 1920s liberation movement
humus eau de parfum,Mad et Len," Darkly earthy yet humming with subtle musky energy, Humus is a primally comforting scent. The richness of volcanic topsoil is evoked through a blend of cool, earthy mushroom, smooth oakmoss, and grassy, gently spicy vetiver, while a sharp violet and aromatic pine provide sophisticated depth, capped with a uniquely mineralic, chalky pebble note. The effect is hyper-natural: unmistakably the scent of ancient earth and new growth, but experienced through an invigorating aromatic mist, alluring and mysterious. An utterly elemental experience."," Violet, oakmoss, mushroom, pebbles, pine tree, vetiver",darkly earthy yet hum subtle musky energy humus primally comfort scent richness volcanic topsoil evoke blend cool earthy mushroom smooth oakmoss grassy gently spicy vetiver sharp violet aromatic pine provide sophisticated depth cap uniquely mineralic chalky pebble note effect hypernatural unmistakably scent ancient earth new growth experienced invigorate aromatic mist alluring mysterious utterly elemental experience
musc des sables eau de parfum,Les Indemodables," What do you get when you combine two of the costliest ingredients in perfumeryambergris and orriswith animalic musks and spices? In Antoine Lie's hands, a mysteriously sexy elixir that melts into skin, leaving a sheer but substantial trace of fairy dust that's subtly sweet, spicy, sensuous, and ever-evolving.Musc des Sables opens with a fresh, bright mandarin note that seamlessly transitions into cozy, spiced opulence. Ambergris in contemporary, even luxury perfumes, is mostly synthetic due to its price and scarcity, but the ambergris at Musc des Sables' hearttinctured from authentic ambre gris (grey amber) through a 6-month process done specifically for Les IndÃ©modables at its founders' labpulsates with sensuality and complexity. Anyone who's smelled this classical perfume ingredient in its authentic form in vintage or bespoke formulas will recognize it here as the real deal for its earthy, animalic and even tabacco-like warmth that leaves its trace hours into wearing it. Combined with creamy orris, spices, patchouli and musk, Musc des Sables' heady formula somehow maintains a diaphanousyet persistent lightness.

iris perle eau de parfum,Les Indemodables," Like some beautiful faces so gorgeous you're not sure what feature to pay attention to first, the elegant Iris Perle is an embarrassment of riches.Perhaps the first thing you notice is coolness, as if elegance turned itself into silk, shimmering in the light. The multifaceted mimosa bloom, so fresh and representative of that honeyed floral you'd think its scent was radiating from under your nose by the warmth of the sun, combines with sultry jasmine and bright ylang-ylang. Maybe the violet leaves or clary sage that keep the composition fresh catch your attention first, or the huge amount of the most expensive perfume ingredient in the worldorris, the sensual backdrop to Iris Perle that is at once earthy, cool, sensual, and creamy.Whatever it is you notice first, or all at once, these are not ordinary ingredients. They're the Platonic Ideal, whose journey from plant to bottle was ushered with experience and care by their founders. The Moroccan mimosa absolute in Iris Perle is extracted in their lab from carefully hand-selected flower buds only, whereas the entire flower and stem is usually used in other perfumes with mimosa notes. This accounts for its smooth, rich floralcy that edits out unwanted herbaceous qualities. And from the time it's planted until it's extracted, it takes seven years for orris root to deliver its oil, like a pearl in the world of perfumery. Iris Perle gets its French orris fromgrand cru crops exclusive to Les IndÃ©modables.Antoine Lie has wrested from all of these superior ingredients their most singing and luscious qualities, leaving for the dramatic backdrop a kind of textural perfume: rich, buttery, gleaming, and smooth, like an iridescent pearl."," French orris absolute grand cru, Morrocan mimosa absolute, Indian jasmine absolute, Madagascan ylang-ylang, Clary sage from the Alps",like beautiful face gorgeous not sure feature pay attention first elegant iris perle embarrassment rich perhaps first thing notice coolness elegance turn silk shimmering light multifacete mimosa bloom fresh representative honey floral would think scent radiate nose warmth sun combine sultry jasmine bright ylangylang maybe violet leave clary sage keep composition fresh catch attention first huge amount expensive perfume ingredient worldorris sensual backdrop iris perle earthy cool sensual creamy whatever notice first not ordinary ingredient platonic ideal whose journey plant bottle usher experience care founder moroccan mimosa absolute iris perle extract lab carefully handselecte flower bud whereas entire flower stem usually use perfumes mimosa note account smooth rich floralcy edit unwanted herbaceous quality time plant extract take seven year orris root deliver oil like pearl world perfumery iris perle get french orris fromgrand cru crop exclusive les indamodables antoine lie wrest superior ingredient singing luscious quality leave dramatic backdrop kind textural perfume rich buttery gleam smooth like iridescent pearl
rose de jamal eau de parfum,Les Indemodables," Rose de Jamal asks you to rethink this iconic perfume note,  long consigned in the mainstream perfume imagination as something stodgy,  old fashioned,  and too conventionally feminine. And one whiff of it will have you feeling,  to borrow a song lyric,  like a perfume virgin,  sniffing rose as if for the very first time. Its avant-garde construction by perfumer Antoine Lie takes the Moroccan damascena rose absolute at its heart far away from its classical use,  thanks largely to its pairing with a special MoroccanNaneh mint,  a variety of spearmint especially sweet and aromatic and used in Moroccan drinks and teas. Although this mint might move Rose de Jamal toward amasculine fougÃ¨re,  it perhaps ideally helps to deconstruct any ingrained ideas of gender in rose,  producing only the more perfume-centric thought,  This is beautiful.Rose de Jamal is also unusual for its massive 5.5% dose of Moroccan rose absolute. In addition there are 500 grams of freshly harvested rose buds per bottle of Rose de Jamal  the equivalent of more than 100 roses. Smelling Rose de Jamal might also produce the feeling of smelling rose for the very first time,  Lie has suggested in interviews,  because its realness is radically different from the scent of synthetically constructed rose accords in most perfumes with rose. The rose here is lush,  velvety,  almost suede-like,  subliminally pulling you into its mysterious heart even as you might only be smelling its lush beauty. What also makes Rose de Jamal special is its name: named after the Les IndÃ©modable exclusive partner in Morocco,  Jamal Chaboun,  who produces this special Rose harvest (among other ingredients). Jamal owns his plantations,  controls the crops,  and has mastered extraction processes.Jamal loves his business and is very proud of his raw materials,  Lie said in an interview.We decided to make a perfume homage to the gentleman,  to take him from the shadows."," Moroccan damascene rose absolute, Moroccan cedarwood, Madagascan pink pepper C02, Morocan Naneh mint, lavender",rise de jamal ask rethink iconic perfume note long consigned mainstream perfume imagination something stodgy old fashioned conventionally feminine one whiff feel borrow song lyric like perfume virgin sniff rise first time avantgarde construction perfumer antoine lie take moroccan damascena rise absolute heart far away classical use thanks largely pair special moroccannaneh mint variety spearmint especially sweet aromatic use moroccan drink teas although mint may move rise de jamal toward amasculine fouga perhaps ideally help deconstruct ingrain idea gender rise produce perfumecentric think beautiful rise de jamal also unusual massive 55 dose moroccan rise absolute addition 500 grams freshly harvest rise bud per bottle rise de jamal equivalent 100 rose smell rise de jamal may also produce feel smell rise first time lie suggest interview realness radically different scent synthetically construct rise accord perfumes rise rise lush velvety almost suedelike subliminally pull mysterious heart even may smell lush beauty also make rise de jamal special name name les indamodable exclusive partner morocco jamal chaboun produce special rise harvest among ingredient jamal plantation control crop master extraction process jamal love business proud raw material lie say interviewwe decide make perfume homage gentleman take shadow

brandied pear eau de parfum,Panah London," Panah has quickly gained our attention for scents that effortlessly balance delectable gourmand elements with an everyday wearable lightness, and Brandied Pear may be the best of the bunch. Boasting a succulent, refreshing fruitiness to offset the dessert's decadent construction, this is less a gourmand, and more a fruit-forward delight with just enough vanillic sweetness to leave us swooning. The central player is, we're happy to confirm, the pear- mouthwatering, gently spiced, and sweetened not with syrupy sugar but rather just a touch of ripe banana. Only after we've had some time to exult in this perfect pear does it get the after-dinner treatment- a simmer in rich, warm, boozy brandy and a drizzle of indulgent vanilla cream. All the while, zesty lemon, verdant green leaves, and a wisp of soft musk keep things fresh and not too sweet, ensuring its unisex appeal.

nefs extrait de parfum,Nishane," Like Istanbul itself, the masterful creations of Nishane straddle the line between Europe and Asia, synthesizing the palettes and traditions of both in the service of dynamic, modern perfumery. And so it's unsurprising that Nefs, conceptualized as the line's flagship oriental scent, wouldn't be content to simply recycle the genre's standard spicy floral opulence, but would instead strive for a new, modern oriental- an East-meets-West portrait of refined luxury to sway even those who dislike oriental fragrances.  Keep in mind that when we say luxurious, we mean it- this is Nishane's most indulgently constructed fragrance yet, with authentic aged oud, exquisite harvests of rose, jasmine, and osmanthus, and a vibrant, saffron-led spice bouquet. Gently sweetened with honey and the balanced booziness of whiskey, the florals and spice stay lively on the skin, subverting any associations of oriental scents with oppressive heaviness or vintage stuffiness. A rich, smooth, gently gourmand woodsy base adds a sensual touch of modernity. Like a breeze blowing from the east across the Bosporus, Nefs is an exquisite oriental that bridges the gap between civilizations."," Honey, violet, sage, saffron, fig, rose, osmanthus, geranium, jasmine, nutmeg, amber, whiskey, oud, cinnamon, cedar, gurjam balsam, leather, vanilla",like istanbul masterful creation nishane straddle line europe asia synthesize palette tradition service dynamic modern perfumery unsurprising nefs conceptualize line flagship oriental scent would not content simply recycle genre standard spicy floral opulence would instead strive new modern oriental eastmeetsw portrait refined luxury sway even dislike oriental fragrance keep mind say luxurious mean nishanes indulgently construct fragrance yet authentic aged oud exquisite harvest rise jasmine osmanthus vibrant saffronle spice bouquet gently sweeten honey balance booziness whiskey floral spice stay lively skin subverting association oriental scent oppressive heaviness vintage stuffiness rich smooth gently gourmand woodsy base add sensual touch modernity like breeze blow east across bosporus nefs exquisite oriental bridge gap civilization
megamare parfum,Orto Parisi," A portrait of the beauty that lies on the surface of the ocean, and the dangers of the salty depths below. Megamare is a swirling typhoon of a scent, a heady wash of brackish water, biting green algae, spicy-sweet sea air, and a sparkling musk that radiates with the intensity of the midday sun reflecting off the rolling waves of the open ocean. With immense longevity and powerful projection. Tranquil and terrifying, serene and sensual, Megamare radiates the yin and yang of the sea.","Spicy, Sweet, Sparkling Musk, Oceany",portrait beauty lie surface ocean danger salty depth megamare swirl typhoon scent heady wash brackish water bite green algae spicysweet sea air sparkle musk radiates intensity midday sun reflect roll wave open ocean immense longevity powerful projection tranquil terrify serene sensual megamare radiates yin yang sea
mahabah eau de parfum,ANFAS," Mahaba, meaninglove but alsocharity in Arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. A bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. In the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. Mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends Un Bois Vanille (Serge Lutens) its mysterious darkness. Later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. Feminine, lovely, and unusual, Mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing."," petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",mahaba meaninglove alsocharity arabic unique floriental composition convey youthful innocence lusty warmth one breath bight candy lemon topnote yield startling ylang note balance usual impression fruity lush tropicalia undertone leathery licorice rubber background sultry combination vanilla tonka bean create buff creamy accent like bitter almond horchata dust candy aniseed sprinkles mahaba gorgeously creamy never sweet something licoriceandcoffee woodiness lend un bois vanille serge lutens mysterious darkness later towards final drydown strike note salt brine lurk wing pop create curious effect flower mixed creamy anisic milk melon rind thickly encrust sea salt feminine lovely unusual mahaba floral oriental tailormade moment want scent convey certain youthful sweetness also little twist keep people guess
shaghaf eau de parfum,ANFAS," Shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in Arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the Anfas crown. The simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis  a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business  in the heart of a Middle Eastern city. Shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.Shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. The spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the Ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. But soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. Slowly, a worn leather note emerges  or maybe it is black tea  thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. Shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the Middle East to smell like. But for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. With its toasty, sandy texture, Shaghaf occupies the same headspace as Fidelis (by Histoires de Parfum), Nanban (Arquiste), and Songe d'Un Bois en EtÃ© (Guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. Silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but Shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. With the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. Color us impressed  this bad boy is a Muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it."," cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",shaghaf meaning passion sensual desire arabic us jewel anfas crown simplest way describe would say smell exactly like walk centuriesold majlis huge carpet room receive honor guest conduct parliamentary business heart middle eastern city shaghaf smell like old wood textile long absorb lusty aromas burn oud wood preparation tea coffee boil cardamom clove smoky sweetness million assorted grade bakhoor seep hair wool fur release air sigh shaghaf open wave thrillingly exotic note crest funkysmoky oud note make even grimier lusty ginger cardamom underlining spice oud accord like beastly shadow creeps along wall along kaaba presence dark everpresent soon notice heart magnificently dry oud wood smoldering heat ember peppered chunk amber resin glitter incense slowly wear leather note emerge maybe black tea thick meaty stew resin spice shaghaf dry rich perfume microcosm everything imagine middle east smell like husky desiccation wonderfully warm invite scent toasty sandy texture shaghaf occupie headspace fidelis histoire de parfum nanban arquiste songe dun bois en eta guerlain much soft smoother no harsh woody buzz around edges silage longevity monumental scent shaghaf rare beastmode oriental actually get well interesting long skin heat skin get go scent seem expand radiate skin big redgold wave aroma undulating richness saturation color us impress bad boy muezzins call prayer scent form nothing holy
red ishq eau de parfum,ANFAS,"I cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and I cannot express my love for you. You are me, I move with you. Red ISHQ is perfumer Asim Al Qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. Accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron  dry, slightly bitter  is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. Think Tuscan Leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.Oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. The drydown of Red ISHQ features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of Encens Flamboyant (Annick Goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of Baccarat Rouge (Maison Francis Kurkdijan). Despite the pert raspberry note up front, Red ISHQ is completely unisex  a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water."," jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",not describe moment name mention not express love move red ishq perfumer asim al qassim vision yin yang true love bittersweet sacrifice submission balance envelop warmth unconditional love accordingly initial burst leathery saffron dry slightly bitter soften luscious raspberry cloud rosy talc think tuscan leather buttery suede jacket dust fuchsiacolore powder oakmoss take rein drydown distinctive aroma dry sea lichen marine ink sea grass give scent interesting salty dryness nevertheless stay firmly root leather genre rather chypre drydown red ishq feature smoky ashy fir balsam note paint parallel balsamic freshness encen flamboyant annick goutal abstract crushedruby balminess baccarat rouge maison francis kurkdijan despite pert raspberry note front red ishq completely unisex uniquely freshbutrich saffron suede unamiish bite make mouth water
green gaya eau de parfum,ANFAS," Bright, fresh, and unashamedly cheerful, Green Gaya whisks us on a journey to a true oasis, where its bounty of succulent fruit and spicy woods is all the richer for the vastness of the desert that surrounds it. Picture an exotic dessert, created from the ripest, juiciest fruits a kingdom could produce- sticky, mouthwatering mango and plump, smooth, gently floral pear, enhanced with a daring dose of sweet cardamom and rich star anise. A delectably creamy milk heart heightens the gourmand delicacy, while a balancing accord of crisp, stout cedarwood and a gentle touch of oud cut through the sweet and creamy notes to provide energy and structure. A warm amber base paired with dry iris suggests the stifling heat just outside of our hideaway, heightening the contrast and enhancing the refreshing vitality."," Anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris",bright fresh unashamedly cheerful green gaya whisks us journey true oasis bounty succulent fruit spicy wood rich vastness desert surround picture exotic dessert create ripe juiciest fruit kingdom could produce sticky mouthwatere mango plump smooth gently floral pear enhance dare dose sweet cardamom rich star anise delectably creamy milk heart heightens gourmand delicacy balance accord crisp stout cedarwood gentle touch oud cut sweet creamy note provide energy structure warm amber base pair dry iris suggest stifle heat outside hideaway heighten contrast enhance refreshing vitality
purple sakan,ANFAS," Purple Sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. It is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. But as Purple Sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. Rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. Purple Sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of Asim al Qassim's Emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an Arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal."," Bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",purple sakan fragrance dedicated nostalgia power scent evoke not memory event distinctive emotional sensory tableau treasure moment wonder impressively spicy oriental hides impressive complexity behind subtle agreeable facade smooth amber purple sakan develop grow vibrance grow leaps bound earthy green cardamom leaps skin propel bright dry citrus rich savory coffee cumin complement creamy vanilla base basenote sweet earthy patchouli clean musk let spice continue sing purple sakan may specific reference nostalgia asim al qassim emirati upbringing unique flavor smell arab kitchen warmth comfort infuse every drop magical elixir universal
gold watan eau de parfum,ANFAS," ""A story written with golden water... a history that cannot be erased...""Inspired by the feeling of pure luxury conveyed by both pure gold and pure oud, Gold Watan is a shimmering vision of romance and exoticism. From the first spray, its royal lineage is clear, as the top notes feature a rich, resinous, potent oud and cistus combination usually reserved for a scent's latter phases. In this instance, however, it proves the perfect introduction- powerfully evocative, yet so well balanced that the subtly sweet and smoky tones have room to shift and move, leading into an exuberant heart of woodsy, spicy nagarmotha and a smooth, multi-colored floral accord that adds softness to the oud's pungent authenticity. Pillowy musk and the perfect amount of mouthwatering, crystalline sugar complete the intriguingly parallel evolution of the scent, as the progression from rugged to refined happens with such designed subtlety that you may not realize quite what's happened until you find that you simply cannot stop sniffing your wrist. Sumptuous and authentic, yet delicious and delightful, Gold Watan is an unforgettable oud fragrance."," Cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar",story write golden water history not erase inspire feel pure luxury convey pure gold pure oud gold watan shimmering vision romance exoticism first spray royal lineage clear top note feature rich resinous potent oud cistus combination usually reserved scent latter phase instance however prof perfect introduction powerfully evocative yet well balance subtly sweet smoky tone room shift move lead exuberant heart woodsy spicy nagarmotha smooth multicolore floral accord add softness ouds pungent authenticity pillowy musk perfect amount mouthwatere crystalline sugar complete intriguingly parallel evolution scent progression rugged refined happen design subtlety may not realize quite happen find simply not stop sniff wrist sumptuous authentic yet delicious delightful gold watan unforgettable oud fragrance
rahaba eau de parfum,ANFAS," Rahaba is the Arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. In Arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously  and Rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. It opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. A fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. There is a touch of gin, too  but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. This barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. However, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find Rahaba tremendously inviting. The bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. The drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. Rahaba is, in its final hours, a mÃ©lange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk  perhaps Ambrox  that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy."," orange, gin, pineapple, Damask rose, Grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",rahaba arabic word openness especially openness require host arab culture role host take seriously rahaba scent reflect generosity spirit require open beguile mixture fresh dry pineapple mimicking tray sweetmeat typically offer upon arrival fizzy lemonade note inject scent ferocious sparkle joie de vivre touch gin fresh outdoorsy juniper note anything truly boozy barrage vibrant fruity fizzy note interlude soft restful bouquet rise lightly dust iris lend discreetly powdery texture scent however like host welcome everyone equal grace man woman alike find rahaba tremendously invite bright candy pineapple floral note fade away slowly blond freshlycut woody accord maintains scent sparkle feel drydown curiously airy salty nutty tonka bean hold together spine rahaba final hour malange tart fruity note graft onto hugely spacious ambery musk perhaps ambrox expand scent roomfille proportion without lose delicacy
samaha,ANFAS," Samaha, meaning tolerance and magnanimity in Arabic, is a modern Venus on a Half Shell. Picture a bosomy bouquet of freshly-cut flowers emerging from a fine misting of sea spray, and then wrapped in a cloud of soapy floral musks and the steamy vapors of feminine bathing rituals. Like its antecedents, Amouage Gold or Madame Rochas, Samaha is a classically feminine scent that manages to be refined and faintly suggestive at the same time. Flirting with the line between freshly-scrubbed and richly suggestive, it channels the classic triad of Grasse-grown jasmine, rose, and neroli through the red velvet corridor of a Parisian boudoir. There are no aldehydes here, nothing fusty or old-fashioned, and yet its perfumey cloud of abstract flowers and bathroomy musks clearly draws on a French tradition of perfumery. The key difference is the salty, lemony radiance that suffuses the structure with air and light  Samaha is full-bodied, but light, like the fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake you can imagine."," citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk",samaha meaning tolerance magnanimity arabic modern venus half shell picture bosomy bouquet freshlycut flower emerge fine mist sea spray wrap cloud soapy floral musks steamy vapor feminine bathing ritual like antecedent amouage gold madame rochas samaha classically feminine scent manage refined faintly suggestive time flirt line freshlyscrubbe richly suggestive channel classic triad grassegrown jasmine rise neroli red velvet corridor parisian boudoir no aldehyde nothing fusty oldfashione yet perfumey cloud abstract flower bathroomy musks clearly draws french tradition perfumery key difference salty lemony radiance suffuse structure air light samaha fullbodie light like fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake imagine
sa'adah eau de parfum,ANFAS," Sa'adah is an Arabic name for girls that means happiness'. And indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. Opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. Soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. We see Sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. Crucially, though, Sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to age' it. It is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. A warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. A happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal."," orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",saadah arabic name girl mean happiness indeed scent hold true inspiration opening bright fresh candy orange note bed violet rise scent quickly establishes mood board good vibes soft vibrant pine cedar note lend perky floral touch woody sourness keep scent even keel see saadah appeal young woman like flower abstract rather literal bouquet flower blur give impression bright candy freshness later voluptuous ylang enter picture buttery richness crucially though saadah smell clean modern no aldehyde powder age happy bright floral cut free association floral perfumery past warm resiny tonka vanilla base wraps floral softly caramelize brown sugar haze sweet not give anyone toothache happy floral upbeat sort gal

papyrus oud eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 2003, Michel Almairac released the instantly iconic Gucci pour Homme, a boldly warm and woodsy men's scent featuring a proprietary ""papyrus wood"" accord that defied the fresh, synthetic trends of the time to become a modern classic. Now, almost two decades later, Almairac returns to his beloved creation through a niche fragrance lens- with an emphasis on smoky, spicy complexity- and the result is Papyrus Oud, a vision of masculine elegance and warm sophistication.The key to Papyrus Oud's timeless appeal is evident in the east-meets-west nature of its composition, with classically French floral and aromatic notes of lavender, geranium, oakmoss and jasmine injecting vibrant elegance into the luxuriously Middle Eastern melange of fiery spice, papyrus, agarwood, and incense. The result is a scent that feels full but never heavy, distinctive but smooth and surprisingly easy to wear- a true signature scent that, while leaning masculine, smells out-of-this-world good on just about anyone. Whether you've long missed Gucci pour Homme or are simply looking for something that casts aside the trends of the day for something better, Papyrus Oud is a gift from above."," Papyrus, Incense, Patchouli, Oud, Musk, Chocolate, Ginger",2003 michel almairac release instantly iconic gucci pour homme boldly warm woodsy men scent feature proprietary papyrus wood accord defy fresh synthetic trend time become modern classic almost two decade later almairac return beloved creation niche fragrance lens emphasis smoky spicy complexity result papyrus oud vision masculine elegance warm sophistication key papyrus ouds timeless appeal evident eastmeetsw nature composition classically french floral aromatic note lavender geranium oakmoss jasmine inject vibrant elegance luxuriously middle eastern melange fiery spice papyrus agarwood incense result scent feel full never heavy distinctive smooth surprisingly easy wear true signature scent lean masculine smell outofthisworld good anyone whether long miss gucci pour homme simply look something casts aside trend day something well papyrus oud gift
gardens of india eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. It's this latter philosophy that guides Gardens of India, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. As basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of Gardens of India is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer Michel Almairac spent refining the formula. It begins with jasmine buds, plucked in June and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. Tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. Finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. The scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. Take a walk through the Gardens of India- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there."," Jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",fragrance achieve sophistication via complex arrangement dozen even hundred note however know simply perfect ratio simply perfect material capacity astound latter philosophy guide gardens india deeply romantic scent deploys three wonderful ingredient jasmine tuberose sandalwood magnificent unforgettable effect basic note list may astonishing balance gardens india tribute twenty year master perfumer michel almairac spend refining formula begin jasmine bud pluck june allow hatch extract scent order extract lush white floral note bright dewey greenness tuberose harvest early autumn blooms full preserve intense carnality sweet richness majestic flower finally sandalwood distil rich woodsy creamy perfection scent romantic fullbodie invigorate everything woodsy floral take walk gardens india think surprised much find wait
blackpepper eau de parfum,Comme des Garcons," Blackpepper is the pitch black of a starless sky rendered into perfume form. A perfect storm ofblack flavor molecules clash as if in a Super Collider  pungent black pepper, charred cedar, and smoky Akigala wood sparking off against each other and then pulling apart, over and over again. Wearing this scent is like slowly adjusting your eyes to pitch darkness; with time, an incredible wealth of detail is revealed. The fragrance is deep, hot, and oily, but at the same time, it's as dry as a bone. The burnt sugar of tonka bean softens the searing heat of the pepper, like the edge of a cedar log caramelizing on an open fire. A remarkably crisp, airy fragrance emerges phoenix-like from the hot ashes.

floriental eau de parfum,Comme des Garcons," Even if you were unfamiliar with the term, you'd know a 'floriental' when you smelled it- this fragrance family combining floral notes with the dark woods, spices and resins that distinguish orientals are so popular as to be nearly ubiquitous. But with Comme des GarÃ§ons, there's always a twist, and so Floriental, the newest fragrance from the avant garde Japanese/French fashion stalwart, has chosen as its floral of note the Cistus flower- a flower without a scent. And so, CDG's Floriental is a postmodern floral, one where the sweet, lush, peppery aspects of flowers are created from plum, pink pepper, and sandalwood, and where labdanum- the rich resin that's the true fragrant bounty of the cistus bush- forms the basis of the oriental notes for a floral oriental both innovative and yet true in spirit. And in the modern, mischievous style of Comme des GarÃ§ons, Floriental is even nontraditional in structure- without classically defined top, heart and base notes, the fragrance evolves in unpredictable waves, trading off between lush fruitiness, resinous woods and fiery spice with delightful frequency, resulting in a scent that wears differently each time. At once layered and unstructured, simple and modern, masculine and feminine, Floriental is a landscape of wonderful contradiction, with a single exception- it's 100% CDG."," Pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver",even unfamiliar term would know floriental smell fragrance family combine floral note dark wood spice resin distinguish oriental popular nearly ubiquitous comme des garaon always twist floriental new fragrance avant garde japanese french fashion stalwart choose floral note cistus flower flower without scent cdgs floriental postmodern floral one sweet lush peppery aspect flower create plum pink pepper sandalwood labdanum rich resin true fragrant bounty cistus bush form basis oriental note floral oriental innovative yet true spirit modern mischievous style comme des garaon floriental even nontraditional structure without classically define top heart base note fragrance evolve unpredictable wave trading lush fruitiness resinous wood fiery spice delightful frequency result scent wear differently time layered unstructured simple modern masculine feminine floriental landscape wonderful contradiction single exception 100 cdg
dot eau de parfum,Comme des Garcons," The deceptive simplicity and industrial whimsy that define the Comme des GarÃ§ons aesthetic has always proven to be a remarkably versatile template for all types of fragrances. Dot, the newest release from the venerable house, demonstrates this with great aplomb: a fresh, fruity floral with wonderfully unique touches of resin and green notes, Dot is both lusciously feminine, but also distinctly CDG. Inspired not only by the smell of the Osmanthus flower but equally by the mysterious allure of a park filled with Osmanthus trees in bloom, Dot is more tone-poem than standard soliflore. The scent radiates with floral smoothness, but also with the fruity tonalities that emanates from the blossoms, the radiant green notes that illustrate the leaves, and white ambery woods that reflect the bark of the tree. Resinous olibanum gives the distinct character of a park set within a bustling cityscape, and pepper oil further enhances the balsamic, spicy aspect of the incense. The result is just as pretty as one could hope for, but with the distinctive character of another wonderfully modern Comme des GarÃ§ons creation.

l'eau de reims,Reims Parfums," L'Eau de Reims smells very French. Primarily an essay on the fresh, celery-like greenness of petitgrain and neroli, Duchaufour twists things in a slightly chyprÃ© direction with a generous lick of salty, dark green oakmoss. Even more delightfully, proceedings open here with a volley of bitter, lemony eau de cologne-style notes that last just long enough to jolt its wearer awake. The real star of L'Eau de Reims, however, is that remarkable petitgrain-neroli accord. Although neroli is not listed, we're sure we smell its modulating influence here, softening the lemony sharpness of the petitgrain with its characteristic soapy freshness and its lingering vegetal notes. A hint of geranium emphasizes the spicy, leafy greenness of the neroli. Oakmoss provides structure to the drydown, supporting the freshness of the petitgrain-neroli heart with a robust, salty minerality that never strays into dankness. We think L'Eau de Reims is a real tour de force for summer wear  as fresh and clean as a traditional eau de cologne, yet with the salty heft of a properly French chypre base.

haute provence eau de cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," While wild lavender abounds throughout the countryside of Provence,  master perfumers know that ""true lavender, "" that which only grows at an altitude above 1200 meters,  has no substitute- boasting both fresher,  more camphorous tones and a sweeter,  richer,  warmer tone as it dries,  it's a superior material in every way to its common counterpart. So it's no surprise that Mme. Patricia de Nicolai,  perhaps the greatest living inheritor of the grand legacy of vintage French perfumery,  accepts nothing less than Haute Provence lavender in her fragrances,  and believes in its value as an ingredient so much that she presents it here,  with minimal embellishment,  as an eau de cologne- and the results are impressive. If anything,  the openness of an EDC lets the star ingredient shine,  delivering intensely sharp,  bright freshness up top,  complemented with spicy,  citric petitgrain,  and then drying to a smooth,  creamy iris-paired musky woodsiness that lingers with just the right amount of unassuming confidence on the skin.

unutamam extrait de parfum,Nishane," As the first entry in Nishane's bold new ""Experimental Collection, "" Unutamam was bound to defy easy categorization. But that turns out to be the point: as conceived by Nishane and star fragrance blogger and creator Miguel Matos,  Unutamam (the name of a famous Turkish song) intentionally straddles the line between lush seduction and animalic ferocity,  leaving it to the wearer to decide which mood to allow the scent to embody. Unutamam,  from first spray,  is an intense experience: a whip's lash of lacerating aromatics and florals,  defying any attempt at a complacent reaction. Even as the florals grow smoother and lusher,  a smoky,  industrial undertone grows,  with patchouli,  labdanum,  and castoreum approximating the animalic thrum of petroleum,  the rough protection of military-grade leather. Or perhaps your journey into this intriguing and dynamic fragrance takes you in the other direction,  to a garden of herbaceous delight and sweet,  smooth caramelized amber.

douce amere eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Devilishly bitter, then divinely sweet  this eccentric brew is a bundle of contradictions from the moment it touches your skin.

The licorice is sharp and the powder is soft and it all melds together in an indescribable way that will having you sneaking off to sniff your arm again and again. Moody and contrary, this is the unexpected lightness of heart at the sight of a gray, rainy day; the decadent thrill of reveling in a bad mood overlong; the sharp stab of melancholy when you hear of someone else being happy.

rahat loukhoum eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in Rome. If you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. It's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.And so it is with Rahat Loukoum. The sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. The base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible.

iris silver mist eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," More iris, more, more, more, Serge Lutens famously urged Maurice Roucel when he was composing Iris Silver Mist. Legend has it that poor Maurice went back to the lab and, in his desperation, threw every known iris material into the formula, including a little-used iris nitrile called Irival. What emerged chrysalis-like from this chaotic lab experiment was a wonder of nature and a work of art.Iris Silver Mist smells entirely like a root freshly torn from the ground, caked with earth, dew, and ice. Its purity is lung-filling and green - as bracing as cold water running in a brook. Between the iced, milky roots of the topnotes and the cool musk in the base, clove and benzoin lend the texture a spicy, dusty feel that almost approaches human warmth. But make no mistake  Iris Silver Mist is as brutally pure as a block of ice melting slowly in a forest on the Russian Steppes. As close to wearing a piece of art as you're likely to get. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Orris root, galbanum, sandalwood, cedar, clove, vetiver, musk, benzoin, incense, white amber",iris serge lutens famously urge maurice roucel composing iris silver mist legend poor maurice go back lab desperation throw every know iris material formula include littleuse iris nitrile call irival emerge chrysalislike chaotic lab experiment wonder nature work art iris silver mist smell entirely like root freshly tear ground cake earth dew ice purity lungfille green brace cold water run brook iced milky root topnote cool musk base clove benzoin lend texture spicy dusty feel almost approaches human warmth make no mistake iris silver mist brutally pure block ice melt slowly forest russian steppes close wear piece art likely get please note palais royal collection bell jar splash bottle
bois et musc eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Ahh, Bois et Musc! We have a particular fondness for this unfairly overlooked gem in the Lutens Bois series, which wears like a sunset in smudgy golds and pinks. Bois et Musc is a soft, rosy cedarwood diffused out into a cloud of musk and sweetened with a judicious touch of spice (the notes say saffron, but we also smell a gentle nutmeg, cinnamon, and perhaps even a smattering of cumin). Far woodier and less syrupy-fruity than its siblings in the Bois series  Bois de Violette and Bois et Fruits  Bois et Muscs may actually be closer in spirit to the original Shiseido FeminitÃ© du Bois than the current Serge Lutens version.           More than scent, however, Bois et Musc is all about texture: its musk is velvety and beeswaxy, while its cedarwood is silky. Not as dirty as Muscs Khoublai Khan but not nearly as clean as Clair de Musc, Bois et Musc is, for us, the happy medium of Lutensian musks. It is sensual as hell but in that comfortably discreet way that makes people wonder if you're wearing perfume or just smell particularly good. And when you're wearing Bois et Musc, you most certainly do. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Atlas cedarwood, beeswax, saffron, musk",ahh bois et musc particular fondness unfairly overlook gem lutens bois series wear like sunset smudgy golds pink bois et musc soft rosy cedarwood diffuse cloud musk sweeten judicious touch spice note say saffron also smell gentle nutmeg cinnamon perhaps even smatter cumin far woodier less syrupyfruity siblings bois series bois de violette bois et fruit bois et muscs may actually close spirit original shiseido feminita du bois current serge lutens version scent however bois et musc texture musk velvety beeswaxy cedarwood silky not dirty muscs khoublai khan not nearly clean clair de musc bois et musc us happy medium lutensian musks sensual hell comfortably discreet way make people wonder wear perfume smell particularly good wear bois et musc certainly please note palais royal collection bell jar splash bottle
sarrasins eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Rich yet airy and clear', Sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to La Nuit's dense buttercream satin. Famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. Though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. Sarrasins is very elegant and very French - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. In the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. The dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. Beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. Sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication. Wear Sarrasins to feel inimitably French.  Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," bergamot, labdanum, carnation, osmanthus, jasmine, patchouli, castoreum",rich yet airy clear sarrasin sheer silk shawl la nuit dense buttercream satin famously alluring scent derive charm juxtaposition innocence sensuality though opening burst crystalline jasmine sharpen needlepoint camphor mysterious greenery privet hedge mint freshness immediately counterpoise smudge inky indole sarrasin elegant french rudely botanical hothouse flower style tease chignon heart hint hay tea give jasmine transparency not possess real life dry clovelike spiciness carnation frame crispness green apple grape take straight chiller beneath impression freshness however sultry osmanthus castoreum slyly join force create dark dry apricot leather smell like skin nape neck sarrasin je ne sais quoi emanate contrast live flower tumble vine soft skinlike suede note give abstract sophistication wear sarrasin feel inimitably french please note palais royal collection bell jar splash bottle

winter palace eau de parfum,MEMO," A stunning fantasia of fiery resins and smooth tea, Winter Palace is a mythological vision of China where dragons soar and intrigue lurks behind every gate. We're swept away from the opening burst of rich, oily, tea-infused citrus- miles from both the salty freshness of a Mediterranean citrus scent or the sunny sweetness of a California one- balanced against robust, gently toasty matÃ©. The exotic richness only deepens from here, as the distinctive red tea heart, earthy and subtly tart, takes on richer, more resinous character with a cascade of balsamic woods, as awe-inspiring and powerful as the serpentine form of a Chinese dragon undulating along the hill-studded landscape like a Great Wall in motion. As a deep, warm, vanilla-rich amber emerges in the base, we feel the true power of the scent, compelling and unique, imbued with ancient sophistication but glowing with vibrant potency.

white peaches eau de parfum,Shay & Blue," As delightfully refreshing as a sparkling bellini or a scoop of sorbet on a scorching summer's day, White Peaches is an enchantingly simple burst of joy. Constructed around the unique nature of white peaches, which are sweeter, more floral and less tart than their more common yellow counterparts, White Peaches serves up a delectably ripe peach note, juicy and cool on its own, but made positively thirst-quenching with the addition of an ""iced"" elderflower note, distinctively chilly and wonderfully fresh. A base of silver birch transposes its normally Christmas-y wintergreen aroma to this warm-weather cocktail, revealing another layer of revitalizing crispness. For anyone craving a luscious, authentic, non-syrupy peach note perfect for even the hottest of weather, White Peaches is a delicious delight."," White peach, narcissus, elderflower granita, silver birch",delightfully refreshing sparkle bellini scoop sorbet scorch summer day white peach enchantingly simple burst joy construct around unique nature white peach sweeter floral less tart common yellow counterpart white peach serve delectably ripe peach note juicy cool make positively thirstquenching addition iced elderflow note distinctively chilly wonderfully fresh base silver birch transpose normally christmasy wintergreen aroma warmweather cocktail reveal another layer revitalize crispness anyone craving luscious authentic nonsyrupy peach note perfect even hot weather white peach delicious delight
sundazed eau de parfum,BYREDO," Say hello to endless summer. Sundazed,  the newest scent from Byredo,  is an infectiously joyful blend of bright citrus,  sugared florals,  and a sparkling skin musk that fans of Blanche already know and love. It's a love letter to spontaneous daytrips and wholesome indulgences- the citrus is zesty,  mouthwatering,  and energetic,  the neroli heart rich,  romantic,  and made deliciously sweet with a sugared note of fresh-spun cotton candy. And it all dries down to a clean,  soft musk that glows for hours with the gentle warmth of sun-kissed skin after a long day of outdoor adventures.

eau de minthe eau de parfum,Diptyque," Invented in 1882 with the release of Houbigant's Fougere Royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine European fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of Diptyque. But in case you haven't figured it out from the name, Eau de Minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss DNA of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. Not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. As a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, Eau de Minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. Vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, Eau de Minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats."," Mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",invent 1882 release houbigant fougere royale distinctively fresh classically masculine fougere stalwart fine european fragrance never entry equally iconic house diptyque case not figure name eau de minthe not greatgreat grandfather fougere rather impressively clever twist classic replace standard lavendergeraniumoakmoss dna fougere electric jolt mouthwatere mint place lavender not provide strike unisex balance typically masculine genre builds molecular connection mint geranium lend floral heart scent dynamic aromatic resonance soft patchouli base touch mossy rise lend gentle strength eau de minthe take form recognizable fougere never much delightful individuality lose vibrant fresh utterly unique eau de minthe new classic fougere stand alongside great
splendiris eau de parfum,Dusita," With the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? In the case of the truly magical newest release from Dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- Splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.Splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. As the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals Splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. A perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. In other words, Splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. While we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new Dusita release, Splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",tremendous visual olfactory beauty iris come unique challenge one create iris scent improve upon nature already perfect case truly magical new release dusita answer lie subtlety splendiris showcase utterly breathtake orris absolute cool purple rich powder glory right amount fresh dark gourmand supplemental note modernize brighten smooth whole experience realm sublime splendiris open burst juicy citrus lively gently aromatic green note feel fresh contemporary wipe clean preconception iris scent richly floral heart emerge swoon elegance richness orris butter exploration reveal splendiris much single expensive ingredient natural rooty powdery sophistication iris sweeten violet fig give luscious texture rise jasmine create true bouquet perfect dollop luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver cedar enriche create rare fragrant plateau sensuality style naturalism share top billing word splendiris objectively iris soliflore smell iris not pay attention dozen brilliant combination make gorgeously idealize iris ever experienced grow expect worldclass scent new dusita release splendiris even standard class
malt eau de parfum,Akro," What happens when you cross a peaty Laphroaig whiskey with an aquatic? Malt. Sure, it's the answer to a question we don't remember asking, but we're so happy that such a thing actually exists. Opening with a gorgeously caramelized whiskey note that conjures up both the smokiness and the toffee-like depth of an aged whiskey from the highlands of Scotland, Malt quickly slips into a firmly mid-tone register: rich but light, with toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding it together. This deft lightness of touch is underscored by a minty, anisic tobacco-like note, which the notes say is seaweed. Certainly, this note gains in salt and crunch as time wears on, but while it is redolent of the sea, it less the sweet, melony undertone of Calone-driven aquatics, and more the naturally green, salty outdoorsy air blowing in off the North Sea. Wearing Malt feels like drinking a glass of peaty Scotch with friends at a beach bonfire on a cold October evening, the air infused with salt, heather, and good, old-fashioned bonhomie."," Whiskey, Rum, Leather, Seaweed, Patchouli.",happen cross peaty laphroaig whiskey aquatic malt sure answer question not remember ask happy thing actually exist opening gorgeously caramelize whiskey note conjure smokiness toffeelike depth aged whiskey highland scotland malt quickly slip firmly midtone register rich light toasty brown wood unobtrusively hold together deft lightness touch underscored minty anisic tobaccolike note note say seaweed certainly note gain salt crunch time wear redolent sea less sweet melony undertone calonedriven aquatics naturally green salty outdoorsy air blow north sea wear malt feel like drinking glass peaty scotch friend beach bonfire cold october evening air infuse salt heather good oldfashione bonhomie
dark eau de parfum,Akro," Oh man, this is good. A thick pour of molten dark chocolate to begin with, as strong and as intense as an espresso, but absent any of the metallic or animalic aspects that can sometimes emerge in dark chocolate. This is dark chocolate idealized. It's not sweet or creamy, but there's a strong hint of caramelized milk running underneath the rafters of the scent to pull it back from acridity. It's pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss.Throughout the day, as the dark chocolate tonality ebbs away, a gloriously rich, nutty base steps forward to fill the vacuum. Spicy, cinnamon-flecked tonka and hazelnut notes combine with vanilla to create a suede-textured drydown that seems to go on forever without shedding any of its richness  a thing of beauty in a world where oftentimes the ending is rushed. Interestingly, though from the same hand that created Angel, Dark is its complete opposite  plush but not fruity, and gourmand but not edible or yummy'. Dark is an exquisitely balanced, elegant chocolate quasi-gourmand that leans to the adult side of the indulgence spectrum. An utter pleasure to wear."," Cocoa, Dark Chocolate, Cinnamon, Hazelnut, Vanilla",oh man good thick pour molten dark chocolate begin strong intense espresso absent metallic animalic aspect sometimes emerge dark chocolate dark chocolate idealize not sweet creamy strong hint caramelize milk run underneath rafter scent pull back acridity pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss throughout day dark chocolate tonality ebb away gloriously rich nutty base step forward fill vacuum spicy cinnamonflecke tonka hazelnut note combine vanilla create suedetexture drydown seem go forever without shed richness thing beauty world oftentimes end rush interestingly though hand create angel dark complete opposite plush not fruity gourmand not edible yummy dark exquisitely balance elegant chocolate quasigourmand leans adult side indulgence spectrum utter pleasure wear
night eau de parfum,Akro," Night will make you blush. A finger stroke's worth of cumin imbues an innocently rosy musk with enough inner thigh naughtiness to stop anyone in their track's, retrace their steps, and follow that divine scent to its source: you. Night is sexy because it dances on that barely perceptible line between clean and dirty, never tipping its hand too far in one direction or the other, and therefore keeping you guessing all the way through.Picture the aftermath of love  sheets tangled, traces of clean sweat and passionate kisses cooling quickly on the pillow. Your lover's gone, but everything still smells of them, including your skin and hair. Mingling with the scent of love is the fresh smell of the neroli and rose soap you both washed with that morning, and the starchy brightness of just-laundered sheets. The prismatic dance between clean and dirty, fresh and lived-in in Night is utterly entrancing; it feels sexy and alive and human."," Bulgarian Rose, Cumin, Saffron, Agaroud",night make blush finger stroke worth cumin imbues innocently rosy musk enough inner thigh naughtiness stop anyone track retrace step follow divine scent source night sexy dance barely perceptible line clean dirty never tip hand far one direction therefore keep guess way picture aftermath love sheet tangle trace clean sweat passionate kisses cool quickly pillow lover go everything still smell include skin hair mingle scent love fresh smell neroli rise soap wash morning starchy brightness justlaundere sheet prismatic dance clean dirty fresh livedin night utterly entrancing feel sexy alive human
smoke eau de parfum,Akro," Smoking. The ultimate modern taboo. A dirty word. And yet, for those old enough to remember, there is something viscerally pleasing about the acrid aroma of a freshly-lit cigarette  perhaps because all the more attractive for its illicit, banned-in-public places, worse-than-marijuana notoriety it now enjoys. How AKRO Smoke smells to you will depend on your experience with smoking. For reformed smokers, it will smell nostalgic and haunting, a memory of coats, hair, and rooms impregnated with the acrid scent of cigarettes long stubbed out. For the uninitiated, it may smell almost shockingly intense, boasting a range of aromas from rubber and camphor to ash. A smidgen of sweetness from creamy tonka and powdery benzoin in the base is there for support, but in the end, there is nothing sweet or gourmand about this. Just a transparent, weightless wash of honest-to-goodness second hand cigarette smoke on the skin; sexy in a grimy, lived-in way that's difficult to explain to anyone who's never indulged. If you love Jeke by Slumberhouse, but want a summer-sheer version, then Smoke should be on your sample list."," Balkans Tobacco Leaves, Nicotine, Cade, Benjoin, Tonka Bean",smoking ultimate modern taboo dirty word yet old enough remember something viscerally pleasing acrid aroma freshlylit cigarette perhaps attractive illicit bannedinpublic place worsethanmarijuana notoriety enjoy akro smoke smell depend experience smoking reformed smoker smell nostalgic haunting memory coat hair room impregnate acrid scent cigarette long stub uninitiated may smell almost shockingly intense boasting range aromas rubber camphor ash smidgen sweetness creamy tonka powdery benzoin base support end nothing sweet gourmand transparent weightless wash honesttogoodness second hand cigarette smoke skin sexy grimy livedin way difficult explain anyone never indulge love jeke slumberhouse want summersheer version smoke sample list
haze eau de parfum,Akro," Haze is the aromatic fog of a Bohemian cafÃ©, where the lurid green fairy of absinthe mingles with the sage-bush dryness of an illicit spliff. But surprisingly, before it is all this, it is a whirlwind brush with a kitchen garden after a downpour, a riotous vortex of crushed mint, snapped plant stems, and the herbal dewiness of clary sage. It smells like fresh lavender buds and wet soil, a winning mixture of sun-warmed herbs and the cool dampness of a spring shower. Deeply herbal and green, Haze slowly starts to dry out to the bittersweet, grassy smokiness that will later define it as a creature of the night. A boozy artemisia note adds that anisic, Pernod-like twang that still, years after absinthe was made legal again, feels quite naughty. The impression of marijuana is there, but subtly so, and certainly not enough to get you pulled over by the police. A softly smoky leather accent in the base ties it all together  pulling the scent from bright, wet, sunlit kitchen herbs to poetry reading in a Parisian cafÃ© in one easy, fluid arc. Sexy in a casually-tousled way, Haze is for those who like fresh and aromatic, but done with an irreverent twist."," Absinthe, Armoise, Eucalyptus, Spearmint, Clary Sage",haze aromatic fog bohemian cafa lurid green fairy absinthe mingle sagebush dryness illicit spliff surprisingly whirlwind brush kitchen garden downpour riotous vortex crush mint snap plant stem herbal dewiness clary sage smell like fresh lavender bud wet soil win mixture sunwarmed herbs cool dampness spring shower deeply herbal green haze slowly start dry bittersweet grassy smokiness later define creature night boozy artemisia note add anisic pernodlike twang still year absinthe make legal feel quite naughty impression marijuana subtly certainly not enough get pull police softly smoky leather accent base tie together pull scent bright wet sunlit kitchen herbs poetry read parisian cafa one easy fluid arc sexy casuallytousle way haze like fresh aromatic irreverent twist

bana banana eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The story of Bana Banana is, unlikely as this may seem, the story of the creation of L'Artisan Parfumeur. In the 1970's, chemist and plant collector Jean-Francois Laporte was planning to attend the legendarily exuberant and creative Les Folies Bergeres, and needed to up the ante for his latest look, which was, of course, a banana costume. Drawing on his knowledge of natural materials, he created a banana scent for himself, and in the process he discovered a heretofore unknown passion for fragrance made with traditional methods and exceptional raw materials, a calling that would eventually result in his founding of L'Artisan Parfumeur with the help of master perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena. Now, in collaboration with his daughter Celine Ellena, L'Artisan resurrects that legendary scent, reimagined with all the style, skill, and quality for which the brand has become famous. Oh, but did we mention how unbelievably fun it is? The banana is rich, green, and fruity, surrounded with lively pepper and savory nutmeg, the floral aspects reinforced with milky jasmine and gently powdered iris and violet to coax the impression of ripe banana skin. Warm, tonka-infused amber foregrounds the fruit, lingering like the heat of the sun at dusk. Playful yet sophisticated, and rich in both character and history, Bana Banana is more than just a banana scent- it's the legacy of L'Artisan Parfumeur in a bottle."," Pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber",story bana banana unlikely may seem story creation lartisan parfumeur 1970s chemist plant collector jeanfrancois laporte planning attend legendarily exuberant creative les folie bergere need ante late look course banana costume draw knowledge natural material create banana scent process discover heretofore unknown passion fragrance make traditional method exceptional raw material call would eventually result found lartisan parfumeur help master perfumer jeanclaude ellena collaboration daughter celine ellena lartisan resurrect legendary scent reimagine style skill quality brand become famous oh mention unbelievably fun banana rich green fruity surround lively pepper savory nutmeg floral aspect reinforce milky jasmine gently powder iris violet coax impression ripe banana skin warm tonkainfuse amber foreground fruit linger like heat sun dusk playful yet sophisticated rich character history bana banana banana scent legacy lartisan parfumeur bottle
easy to love eau de parfum,Eau d'Italie," One thing Italians love is an anniversary celebration. And so it's only fitting that the Eau d'Italie fragrance line, created 15 years ago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hotel Le Sireneuse Positano, has now begat a celebratory milestone of its own. Easy To Love, a love letter to fragrance, hospitality, and the stunning beauty of the Amalfi Coast, more than lives up to its name, wrapping us up in a lovely and soothing blend of fresh florals and juicy fig as seductive and timeless as Italy itself. It's a delightful example of quality over complication, with each note playing a vital role- white currant, sweeter than its better-known black and red siblings, still lends a distinctive tart buzz to the creamy, green fig note, made even fresher with a gentle peony. And lest we forget that la dolce vita is as much about sensory pleasures as it is the beauty of nature, Easy To Love features a luscious base of sweet honey, tonka bean, and subtly sensual ambrette musk- a nod to the food, drink, and romance one almost can't help but experience on the Mediterranean.

cassili eau de parfum,Parfums de Marly," At the intersection of desire and delicacy, Cassili is a fruity-floral beauty that reminds us that Parfums de Marly does feminine scents with every bit as much modern-meets-classic complexity as their much-heralded masculines. Exploding with triumphant fruitiness, yet anchored by a sophisticated woodsy gourmand base, Cassili is both fashion-forward and refined, with a true Parfums de Marly signature. From the first spray, Cassili leaps off the skin with joyful abandon, featuring mouthwatering notes of plum and redcurrant set against lushly textured florals- romantic rose, fresh mimosa and peachy plumeria, a delightful bouquet with enough sweetness to swoon over, but also enough floral firepower to seduce.

ganymede eau de parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois," Ganymede, the rocky satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. In collaboration with Quentin Bisch, Marc-Antoine Barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.Ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, B683, an instant classic. This time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. Mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. A galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, Ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. What We Think A saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in B683- airy but still substantial."," Mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, Immortelle absolute",ganymede rocky satellite jupiter discover 1610 galileo luminous cover saltwater oceans collaboration quentin bisch marcantoine barrois dreamt essence new planet elegant unexpected harmony around quartet mandarin violet immortelle suede ganymede make use suedeleathery note make first collaboration b683 instant classic time though leather note become soft gain lightness gentleness contact fragrance violet mandarin still bring intense brightness vivacity yet immortelle add sublime balance use salty mineralic tone act strike counterpoint galactic olfactory harmony delicate balance full energy sensuality contrast ganymede quite unlike fragrance planet elsewhere think saltier floral interpretation ultrasmooth top grain leather also feature b683 airy still substantial
no. 1 tonic blanc eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," As fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot Sunday morning. No. 1 Tonic Blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. The neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. It's a slap in the face of heat.As the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. Yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. The sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. This one's easy  a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat.

no. 2 seve nouvelle eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," SÃ¨ve Nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. With its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. A playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that Wella Balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-Granny Smith apple. This peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. SÃ¨ve Nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. While this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives SÃ¨ve Nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once."," grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",sa nouvelle scent new sap rise boundless energy roil sense excitement no long contain opening salvo pink grapefruit effervesce upwards surge creamy white soap bubble not fail make smile playful raspberry bring blush buttery saffron suede lie beneath joyous pop champaca flower make think clear green shampoos wella balsam make 1970s halfwood halfgranny smith apple peppery explosion citrus flower fizz brightly fold soft incensey drydown almost creamy amber cashmeran sa nouvelle go spiky fuzzy one seamless swoop soft raspberrytinte putty note remain place way modern take fruit flower suede stir wisp temple incense base give sa nouvelle stir sense exotic familiar
no. 3 crepuscule ardent eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," CrÃ©puscule Ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. Echoes of a sweet Tuscan Leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. The intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. CrÃ©puscule Ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an Arabian style amber settles in towards the base. Nothing sweet or syrupy, however  here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. This is the scent that a Valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light."," saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",crapuscule ardent set smoky strand redgold saffron smolder incense burner temple attendant weave jasmine blossom hair echo sweet tuscan leatherlike aroma tease us heat magnifying fug soft leather spice flower fills room intense aroma saffron jasmine pungent creamy like lover breath nape neck crapuscule ardent sexy leather bold increasingly soft milky arabian style amber settle towards base nothing sweet syrupy however monumental frankincense note lend scent charcoal dust purity cleanse air cut fat scent valkyrie wear stride towards pyre glorious vision black gold light
no. 4 apres l'amour eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," AprÃ¨s l'Amour is a 1960's Serge Gainsbourg song filtered through the synth pop sensibilities of the 1980's: candied lemon-rind musks and animalic notes suspended in a haze of modern woody-ambery aromachemicals. It smells like human skin after lovemaking  erotically charged, moist, musky  but thanks to a mesh of powerfully dry, smoky woods and electric ambers, broadcast at high volume to the rest of the world. It's this constant shifting of the scent from intimate to radiant and back to intimate again that makes AprÃ¨s l'Amour work. It seems to come with its own atmosphere - a crackle of electricity in the air; the rumbling of a storm to come. Utterly modern, even a bit brash, it's one of those my-skin-but-better fragrances that send out a subliminal message of attractiveness without you really knowing why or how. If you like scents such as Molecule 01 and Another 13, make sure you don't miss out on AprÃ¨s l'Amour."," bitter orange, lemon zest, aromatic notes, fresh spice, dry wood, amber, musk",apra lamour 1960s serge gainsbourg song filter synth pop sensibility 1980s candy lemonrind musks animalic note suspend haze modern woodyambery aromachemical smell like human skin lovemake erotically charge moist musky thanks mesh powerfully dry smoky wood electric amber broadcast high volume rest world constant shift scent intimate radiant back intimate make apra lamour work seem come atmosphere crackle electricity air rumble storm come utterly modern even bit brash one myskinbutbetter fragrance send subliminal message attractiveness without really know like scent molecule 01 another 13 make sure not miss apra lamour
no. 5 frenesie eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," While most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, FrÃ©nÃ©sie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. Cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. Dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, Japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. The soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. If we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. Either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. A fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. Lovely, and quite innocent-smelling."," saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",oud fragrance proud severe throaty animalic rasp give pause think franasie soft invite freshly powder bosom cow submission expansive floral bouquet dominate apricotty osmanthus oud push edges scent hum away sottovoce dress cloak jammy floral oud transform glaze lychee tart teeter quirky japaneseesque line floral fruity soft gummy suede lurk beneath perfect counterpart syrupy osmanthus rose streaked peppery peony bite not know well would swear violet cast ethereal purple glow bouquet hold together either way oud whisper faint trace something woody low register fuzzy haze musk bring rear diffusing fudgy floral center spacey lightness lovely quite innocentsmelle
no. 6 brume radieuse eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Brume Radieuse proves that Thomas Kosmala has a particular sleight of hand when it comes to creating oud fragrances that depart from the norm. If FrÃ©nÃ©sie is a bon-bon of oud seen through a misty haze of jammy osmanthus, then Brume Radieuse is its equally floral, but grown-up sister, full of a simmering sensuality that makes you sit up straight in your chair. A bruise of blackcurrant juice  thick and tannic  stains the opening a deep purplish black and sets up a sexy fruity-rose beat that carries on throughout. At the heart, a nugget of salty black truffle  this would be the oud  is flanked on all sides by a chorus of juicy peach and coconut notes, the combination of which bears some resemblance to the mouthwatering aquatic-black chocolate accord that underpins Tom Ford's Black Orchid. A veritable riot of fruit, flowers, coconut, peach, and salty-earthy notes, Brume Radieuse shouldn't really work, and yet does. This is one sexy, feminine fruity-floral oud bomb that will not go without notice. The equivalent of that special black dress you wear like a weapon."," blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber",brume radieuse prof thomas kosmala particular sleight hand come create oud fragrance depart norm franasie bonbon oud see misty haze jammy osmanthus brume radieuse equally floral grownup sister full simmer sensuality make sit straight chair bruise blackcurrant juice thick tannic stain opening deep purplish black set sexy fruityrose beat carry throughout heart nugget salty black truffle would oud flank side chorus juicy peach coconut note combination bear resemblance mouthwatere aquaticblack chocolate accord underpin tom ford black orchid veritable riot fruit flower coconut peach saltyearthy note brume radieuse not really work yet one sexy feminine fruityfloral oud bomb not go without notice equivalent special black dress wear like weapon
no. 7 le sel de la terre eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Le Sel de la Terre is proof that Leonardo da Vinci's assertion thatsimplicity is the ultimate sophistication is correct. Infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. If it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that Kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. The musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. Le Sel de la Terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in Monsieur Balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. A salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of Calone or Ambroxan. Fantastic. We know what we're drenching ourselves this summer."," bergamot, Italian lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",le sel de la terre proof leonardo da vincis assertion thatsimplicity ultimate sophistication correct infuse cloudy white musk fresh lemon crusty sea salt note utter perfection sound trite think death know kosmalas take distinguishe pack simply virtue smell entirely natural even clearly not musk clean sweet puff laundryhot air strangely unblemished chemical twang clean solvent enliven expensivesmelle medley lemon bergamot le sel de la terre white shirt freshly pull dryer drape clean body generously douse monsieur balmain paragon elegance pair blond wood citrus salty undertone enough suggest mineral tang beach without make think calone ambroxan fantastic know drench summer
no. 8 tonic vert eau de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Tonic Vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. With its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. Unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. Rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. Yet this is not a classic green scent like No. 19 or even Green Irish Tweed  Tonic Vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. Though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. The combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",tonic vert true tonic winter blue crush mint sour citrus topnote scent start stinging clarity early morning sunshine cut across dark room unlike green fragrance neither soapysoft sappyjuicy rather dry dry dry throughout essential bitterness focus mind straighten spine yet not classic green scent like no 19 even green irish tweed tonic vert make feature modern singlemindedness though naturalistic abstract synthetic nonetheless manage convey impression crisp angularity feel home boardroom ramble field combination earthy bitter vetiver strange pink fruitiness pomelo minty rosiness geranium arrest nth degree murky darkness deep winter want spray let light
no. 9 bukhoor elixir de parfum,Thomas Kosmala," Bukhoor, or bakhoor as it is sometimes known, is the Arabic name for woodchips that have been soaked in precious essential oils, mixed with shards of frankincense and other resins, and finally pressed into soft, brownish bricks to be smoked slowly over an incense burner. All over the Middle East, bukhoor is burned generously to banish domestic smells of cooking and to make the home smell warm and welcoming to visitors. Bukhoor, Thomas Kosmala's take on the theme, honors its source material by being rich, smoky, and pugnacious, with an Arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic. The animalic bite of aged Hindi oud hits the nose first, its characteristic aroma of raw leather, and slightly dirty hay burning a blaze across the olfactory landscape. The scent mellows considerably in the base, where it takes a turn for dry and smoky, a smoldering woods note infusing the atmosphere with the marvelous scent of burnt paper, benzoin, and brown sugar. A bold, no-holds-barred take on an ancient material, and one that proves Kosmala's skill in handling it."," woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk",bukhoor bakhoor sometimes know arabic name woodchip soak precious essential oil mixed shards frankincense resin finally press soft brownish brick smoke slowly incense burner middle east bukhoor burn generously banish domestic smell cooking make home smell warm welcome visitor bukhoor thomas kosmalas take theme honor source material rich smoky pugnacious arabic personality surprisingly authentic animalic bite aged hindi oud hit nose first characteristic aroma raw leather slightly dirty hay burn blaze across olfactory landscape scent mellow considerably base take turn dry smoky smoldering wood note infuse atmosphere marvelous scent burn paper benzoin brown sugar bold noholdsbarre take ancient material one prof kosmalas skill handle
beaute du diable eau de parfum,Liquides Imaginaires," ""Would you be willing to sell your soul to the Devil to possess his perfume? This essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction."" So reads Liquides Imaginaires' tagline for Beaute du Diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. Picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep.

oud monarch extrait de parfum,Bortnikoff," Plenty of fragrances are powerful or complex, but what makes a scent truly regal? In the case of Oud Monarch, the answer is power and complexity in the service of pure, indulgent, delightful comfort. Just as Areej Le Dore's Oud Luwak gave us the why-didn't-we-think-of-that savory voluptuousness of oud and coffee, so too does Oud Monarch delve deep into gourmand territory, delivering a richly mouthwatering cocoa-infused oud scent as luxuriously smooth as the finest royal vestments. While the oud on display is as precious and potent as in any scent we carry (as with all Bortnikoff ouds, it features frequent collaborator Russian Adam's treasured and rare ""Feel Oud""), the introduction of a rich cacao note does a miraculous thing, smoothing the animalic roar of the oud into a smooth and delicious purr that still resonates with power. It's so blissfully intense that it truly takes a moment for your nose to adjust, at which point you can appreciate the masterful attention to detail behind the potency- smooth, sweet florals, spiced tobacco and resin- all perfectly pitched to keep every sniff unique and intriguing. Oud lovers, chocolate fanatics, come together: here is a fragrance fit for a Monarch."," Magnolia, Frangipani, Rose de Mai, Himalayan Rose, Cinnamon, Tobacco, Oud Merauke, Oud co Chang (Feel-oud), Cacao, Civet, Castoreum, Labdanum, Vanilla",plenty fragrance powerful complex make scent truly regal case oud monarch answer power complexity service pure indulgent delightful comfort areej le dore oud luwak give us whydid notwethinkofthat savory voluptuousness oud coffee oud monarch delve deep gourmand territory deliver richly mouthwatere cocoainfuse oud scent luxuriously smooth fine royal vestment oud display precious potent scent carry bortnikoff ouds feature frequent collaborator russian adams treasure rare feel oud introduction rich cacao note miraculous thing smooth animalic roar oud smooth delicious purr still resonate power blissfully intense truly take moment nose adjust point appreciate masterful attention detail behind potency smooth sweet floral spice tobacco resin perfectly pitch keep every sniff unique intriguing oud lover chocolate fanatic come together fragrance fit monarch
amber cologne eau de parfum,Bortnikoff," What makes Bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. Take Amber Cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. It's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. Flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. Perhaps the easiest-to-wear Bortnikoff yet, Amber Cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality."," Bergamot, Lemon, White and Pink Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Cardamom, Frangipani, Jasmine Sambac, Virginia Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Grey and Brown Ambergris, Oud from Sri Lanka, Bouya Oud, Vanilla",make bortnikoff scent special not merely inclusion exceptional material vision require something novel amazing take amber cologne feature impressive amount real grey brown ambergris richly mineralic saltysweet glory increasingly rare star player perfume right mind would put ordinary citrusandwood cologne seem bortnikoff would result turn far ordinary not hurt citrus question eyepoppingly fresh arrest blend juicy bergamot zesty lemon sweet orange deliciously tart grapefruit make mouth water sense ignite ignite find primed gorgeously comfortable blend ambergris wood could ever hope salty gently animalic sure moreover simply aglow luminous warmth drill every level artifice memory connect perfect ideal sunkissed skin beach soft smooth unbelievably sexy flourish floral real oud provide support structure coax every last aspect ambergris glow untold hour sheer bliss perhaps easiesttowear bortnikoff yet amber cologne simple wonderful idea execute flawless mastery unparalleled quality
musk khabib extrait de parfum,Bortnikoff," Musk Khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. Sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. But we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. It's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. Lovers of Areej Le Dore's Russian Musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again.

A must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. Every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey.

vetiver patchouli eau de parfum,Montale," With so much attention paid to Montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello Red Vetiver!). And so it is with great pleasure that we introduce Vetiver Patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. From the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. While we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, Fresh Montale.

oud dream eau de parfum,Montale," When one thinks of a Montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. And while those are wonderful, Oud Dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. The key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. Even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of Roses Musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. Don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of Montale's other oud scents. But once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when Oud Dream has its chance to shine."," Bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",one think montale oud lavishly exotic overthetop cocktail fruit musk come mind wonderful oud dream different sort oud scent delicately sweet spicy musky oud well suited romantic night desert star instead disco ball no matter may look like bottle key difference lovely touch restraint note like sweet honey black pepper fact handle deftly never stickysweet nosecrunchingly spicy even roseoud heart toned opulence rose musk feel smooth romantic keep lean not get us wrong still place opulence montale oud scent sun set situation call touch elegance oud dream chance shine
holy water eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," A rose-and-sandal attar in the body of a French eau de cologne. In the Middle East and India, some attars are composed specifically to protect the soul from djinns, or evil spirits. In the West, we use citrusy colognes to refresh the body in hot weather. Both concepts are rooted in the belief that certain materials in perfumery possess an excoriating, cleansing power to drive out bad spirits and bad smells. Abdes Salaam Attar's Holy Water (Aqua Santa) is a perfume  bridge between the Eastern concept of purifying one's soul and the Western concept of refreshing the physical. In pairing a bitter orange note with a dusty, ethereal frankincense, and placing it all in the context of a fresh eau de cologne, Holy Water emerges as a true hybrid between the Eastern and Western eaux de protection'. It's an almost medieval idea, but it works perfectly. A sweet, carefree orange blossom note gentles the piney austerity of the frankincense, softening what could have been an angular church incense into a hazy cloud of fruit, rose, and sandalwood. Although more fresh than sweet, Holy Water has a pleasing marshmallowy softness at its core that mitigates the impact of the tougher resinous and woody notes. It smells clean, vigorous, and above all, spiritually uplifting. Apply generously in times of sadness, melancholy, or simply when the greyness of the sky is wearing you down. Holy Water is a shot of sunshine delivered straight to your soul."," frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose",roseandsandal attar body french eau de cologne middle east india attars compose specifically protect soul djinns evil spirit west use citrusy cologne refresh body hot weather concept root belief certain material perfumery possess excoriate cleanse power drive bad spirit bad smell abde salaam attars holy water aqua santa perfume bridge eastern concept purifying one soul western concept refreshing physical pair bitter orange note dusty ethereal frankincense place context fresh eau de cologne holy water emerge true hybrid eastern western eaux de protection almost medieval idea work perfectly sweet carefree orange blossom note gentle piney austerity frankincense soften could angular church incense hazy cloud fruit rise sandalwood although fresh sweet holy water pleasing marshmallowy softness core mitigate impact tough resinous woody note smell clean vigorous spiritually uplifting apply generously time sadness melancholy simply greyness sky wear holy water shoot sunshine deliver straight soul
mecca balsam eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Opening on a rich, smoky stew of incense over the crackle of dried tobacco leaf, Mecca Balsam sends the senses reeling, as if you'd suddenly stepped into the scent trail of a thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft as they circle the Black Stone in Mecca. Despite the tarry heft of the sticky balsams and resins, there is an airy sweetness to the underlying structure  a sort of smoked-out incense fairy dust  that elevates the scent and keeps it airborne. A common complaint leveled at incense scents is that they feel cold or severe, but there's no danger of that here. Dubrana has balanced the ancient salve-like feel of the incense with a musky, saline labdanum that reads like warm skin, in one stroke banishing any thought of High Church and drawing our mind instead to what he originally intended Mecca Balsam to reflect: the seething mass of human souls gathered around the Kaaba to perform the Hajj. Mecca Balsam is both sacred and divine, therefore, pitching the throat-catching aridity of incense against the warm, sweet embrace of flowers and amber. Unusual in that it simultaneously purifies and comforts, Mecca Balsam feels less like perfume than it does a statement of faith."," Indian tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean",opening rich smoky stew incense crackle dry tobacco leaf mecca balsam send sense reel would suddenly step scent trail thousand pilgrim hold burn censer aloft circle black stone mecca despite tarry heft sticky balsams resin airy sweetness underlie structure sort smokedout incense fairy dust elevate scent keep airborne common complaint level incense scent feel cold severe no danger dubrana balance ancient salvelike feel incense musky saline labdanum reads like warm skin one stroke banishing think high church draw mind instead originally intend mecca balsam reflect seethe mass human soul gather around kaaba perform hajj mecca balsam sacred divine therefore pitch throatcatche aridity incense warm sweet embrace flower amber unusual simultaneously purifie comfort mecca balsam feel less like perfume statement faith
milano caffe eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Milan is a city that prides itself on the uncompromising purity of its espresso, and in Milano CaffÃ©, the roasted bitterness of the bean meets its match in a square of viciously dark chocolate. If you've ever sipped an espresso while nibbling on a bar of 80% cacao chocolate, then you'll be familiar with the dark, burnt edge that connects them on the Venn diagram of taste. Dubrana feeds it to us straight for a while  no sugar or milk  and it's so intense that little sips are in order. Earthy and bold, the scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like the steamy vapors in a Milanese coffee house. Slowly, the master eases up on the intensity of the coffee-cocoa double whammy, drip-feeding a powdery iris into the mix like a tip of the milk jug. This is followed closely by the mocha almond creamer of tonka bean. Now we move out of pure espresso territory and into the creamy, cocoa-sprinkled milkiness of a cappuccino. It's rich but definitely not sweet, a hint of fiery cinnamon in the opoponax lending a nubbin of spice that adds texture to the silken flow. A dash of incense additionally lends an interesting salt-n-pepper tartness that stops any gourmandise in its tracks. Still incredibly indulgent, Milano CaffÃ© is the tira-mi-su (meaning pick-me-up' in Italian) the adults in the room have been waiting for."," coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber",milan city pride uncompromising purity espresso milano caffa roast bitterness bean meet match square viciously dark chocolate ever sip espresso nibbling bar 80 cacao chocolate familiar dark burn edge connect venn diagram taste dubrana feed us straight no sugar milk intense little sip order earthy bold scent velvety thickness wraps around us like steamy vapor milanese coffee house slowly master ease intensity coffeecocoa double whammy dripfeede powdery iris mix like tip milk jug follow closely mocha almond creamer tonka bean move pure espresso territory creamy cocoasprinkle milkiness cappuccino rich definitely not sweet hint fiery cinnamon opoponax lending nubbin spice add texture silken flow dash incense additionally lend interesting saltnpepper tartness stop gourmandise track still incredibly indulgent milano caffa tiramisu meaning pickmeup italian adult room wait
oakmoss eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Oakmoss (Quercia di Muschio) is deceptively named, because, despite the clear presence of oakmoss, this scent is far more about vetiver than moss. Still, the genius of the fragrance  for us  lies in the fact that Dominique Dubrana has obviously mined the areas of convergence between these two materials to emerge with a creature that has a foot in both worlds. Thus, the marine-like inkiness of the oakmoss connects with the rooty earthiness of vetiver via the crunch of sea salt and a shadowy forest floor' gloom. In the background, a dry, minimally smoky sandalwood provides a palette against which the notes of earth, grass, root, and lichen can really pop. Strangely, for a scent so heavily inspired by the elements of earth, grass, moss, and wood, Oakmoss is far more elegant and pulled together' than the kind of scent you'd throw on for a hike in the woods.

oud caravan no. 1 eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor  what Dubrana termed the Ultimate Oud Fragrance  but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 1 was composed to provide the oud beginner with a primer on what the material actually smells like. To this end, the perfume amalgamates several key characteristics of different oud terroirs and blends them into a seamless whole to give the wearer an idea of the real deal, without compromising on wearability. In Oud Caravan No. 1, the camphoraceous, minty bite of a Borneo-style oud gives the opening a punchy freshness that contrasts delightfully with the animalistic warmth of the aged Indian oud that lies just beneath. Imagine a Bengali tiger and what he smells like: you sense the clean fur of the animal himself, but also the peppery heat of his breath and the dried-straw inkiness of his dung. Indian oud, especially the aged stuff, as used here, is the stuff of Kings - as noble as it is ferociously animalic. Spicy, masculine, and leathery are the three words we'd choose to describe this statement-making scent. Wear it to mark your territory."," natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli",abde salaam attars oud caravan series world first probably crowdsourced oud perfume collection commission arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decide make open source project enlist help group oud connoisseur basenotescom stresst offering oud caravan no 1 originally intend sole perfume endeavor dubrana term ultimate oud fragrance like really good conversation circle friend nobody want end riff endlessly creative ways dubrana harness energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan no 1 compose provide oud beginner primer material actually smell like end perfume amalgamates several key characteristics different oud terroirs blend seamless whole give wearer idea real deal without compromise wearability oud caravan no 1 camphoraceous minty bite borneostyle oud give opening punchy freshness contrast delightfully animalistic warmth aged indian oud lie beneath imagine bengali tiger smell like sense clean fur animal also peppery heat breath driedstraw inkiness dung indian oud especially aged stuff use stuff king noble ferociously animalic spicy masculine leathery three word would choose describe statementmake scent wear mark territory

Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 2 was born out of the suggestions from Dubrana's testing group that No. 1 was simply too leathery, dry, and masculine to win over women. Dubrana listened carefully. After all, his avowed mission with Oud Caravan No. 1 had been to make The Ultimate Oud Fragrance that would sweep newcomers to oud oil, including women, off their feet and expose them to the glory of natural oud. Oud Caravan No. 2 handles the animalistic, barnyardy qualities of oud oil in a much lighter fashion, softening its leathery rudeness with an earthy vanilla and a subdued floral note, something creamy and pale like freshly-opened tuberose buds. The topnotes, similar to No. 1, open with a medicinal, stemmy freshness, which this time seems to come from tuberose rather than from Borneo oud. Although still unmistakably oudy, Oud Caravan No. 2 is an ethereal, dewy take on a famously gruff material  something that Arwen from Lord of The Rings might wear."," natural aged, wild Bengali oud oil, white flowers, Laotian oud oil",abde salaam attars oud caravan series world first probably crowdsourced oud perfume collection commission arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decide make open source project enlist help group oud connoisseur basenotescom stresst offering oud caravan no 1 originally intend sole perfume endeavor dubrana term ultimate oud fragrance like really good conversation circle friend nobody want end riff endlessly creative ways dubrana harness energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan no 2 bear suggestion dubranas testing group no 1 simply leathery dry masculine win woman dubrana listen carefully avow mission oud caravan no 1 make ultimate oud fragrance would sweep newcomer oud oil include woman foot expose glory natural oud oud caravan no 2 handle animalistic barnyardy quality oud oil much light fashion soften leathery rudeness earthy vanilla subdue floral note something creamy pale like freshlyopene tuberose bud topnote similar no 1 open medicinal stemmy freshness time seem come tuberose rather borneo oud although still unmistakably oudy oud caravan no 2 ethereal dewy take famously gruff material something arwen lord ring may wear

Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 3 is the culmination of Dubrana's work on the Caravan series, and the version he feels best encapsulates his vision of a universally-pleasing oud scent. Removing the sharp camphoraceous topnotes that presaged both Caravan No. 1 and No. 2, Dubrana envelops the wild agarwood oil in a warm, fudgy date-like sweetness, using dried fruit and amber notes to subtly nudge the texture dial from leather to velvet. Rich and mellow, Oud Caravan No. 3 goes down smoothly, like a 50-year-old Scotch. Remarkably, Dubrana has steered the oudiness of this scent away from the jungly wetness of the first two scents and towards an airiness that feels like the windows being thrown open onto a closed-up room. As smoky as it is rich, Oud Caravan No. 3 is just animalic enough to remind you that you're wearing real oud, but smooth enough for you to enjoy it without the steep learning curve. As great for women as it is for men."," Natural aged wild Bengali oud oil, dates, labdanum",abde salaam attars oud caravan series world first probably crowdsourced oud perfume collection commission arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decide make open source project enlist help group oud connoisseur basenotescom stresst offering oud caravan no 1 originally intend sole perfume endeavor dubrana term ultimate oud fragrance like really good conversation circle friend nobody want end riff endlessly creative ways dubrana harness energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan no 3 culmination dubranas work caravan series version feel good encapsulates vision universallyplease oud scent remove sharp camphoraceous topnote presage caravan no 1 no 2 dubrana envelop wild agarwood oil warm fudgy datelike sweetness use dry fruit amber note subtly nudge texture dial leather velvet rich mellow oud caravan no 3 go smoothly like 50yearold scotch remarkably dubrana steer oudiness scent away jungly wetness first two scent towards airiness feel like windows throw open onto closedup room smoky rich oud caravan no 3 animalic enough remind wear real oud smooth enough enjoy without steep learn curve great woman man
amber chocolate eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Amber Chocolate is a lush gourmand amber that should come with a sticker that readsfor grown-ups only. Put aside any thoughts you might have of the kind of yummy vanilla-and-berries smell surrounding young girls like a nuclear cloud  this is seriously dark and sexy stuff. A molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. The fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it's a guilt-free indulgence. Despite the almost comically simple name, Amber Chocolate is not a simple affair. There's a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny Cuban tobacco leaf. We think it's the real vanilla absolute that's been used in Amber Chocolate. Woody and resolutely non-sweet, it lends a boozy depth that reads in some lights as brandy or amaretto. Amber Chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes the golden sweetness of amber so effectively that even the amber-averse might be tempted. But honestly, if you ever loved or bought a bottle of Bruno Fazzolari's Ummagumma, Slumberhouse Ore, or Guerlain's Gourmand Coquin, then this boozy chocolate amber is 100% for you."," chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla",amber chocolate lush gourmand amber come sticker readsfor grownup put aside thought may kind yummy vanillaandberrie smell surround young girl like nuclear cloud seriously dark sexy stuff molten dark chocolate note get buff almondy haze tonka bean hint hay roast hazelnut flirt cacao give slightly bitter nonedible edge set apart gourmand fact delicious scent allnatural artisanal mean guiltfree indulgence despite almost comically simple name amber chocolate not simple affair naughty musk patchouli give texture resinous grainy aftertaste like gianduja roll veiny cuban tobacco leaf think real vanilla absolute use amber chocolate woody resolutely nonsweet lend boozy depth reads light brandy amaretto amber chocolate bitter cacao juxtapose golden sweetness amber effectively even amberaverse may tempt honestly ever love buy bottle bruno fazzolaris ummagumma slumberhouse ore guerlain gourmand coquin boozy chocolate amber 100
hindu kush eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Hindu Kush takes its name and inspiration from the 500-mile mountain range running along the hinterlands of Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Pakistan, characterized by wild pine forests that give way to jagged mountain peaks. The scent mirrors the sensory contrast between forest and stone to perfection, capturing in particular the chilly isolation of rugged places unreachable to most humans. It is a meditative scent that taps into our need for silence and contemplation.  The contrasts in Hindu Kush are what drive the scent. In pairing the cool lemon-and-pine notes of pure frankincense with the fiery heat of ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, Hindu Kush achieves an incredible fire-and-ice character that captures our interest throughout. Resinous, mossy woods create the impression of oiled floorboards, a smell that is both comforting and nostalgic. The incense notes are smoky and balsamic, but the freshness of pine leaves drags the priest's censer out of the chapel and into the forest clearing. It's a scent of worship, yes, but here we're worshipping at the altar of Nature herself. Picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat over fires, surrounded by the howling ice winds of the Hindu Kush, and you get an idea of the mysterious alchemy between the culinary and the spiritual at play here. We can think of nothing quite like it."," spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper",hindu kush take name inspiration 500mile mountain range run along hinterlands afghanistan kashmir pakistan characterize wild pine forest give way jagged mountain peak scent mirror sensory contrast forest stone perfection capture particular chilly isolation rugged place unreachable human meditative scent tap need silence contemplation contrast hindu kush drive scent pair cool lemonandpine note pure frankincense fiery heat ginger nutmeg pepper hindu kush achieve incredible fireandice character capture interest throughout resinous mossy wood create impression oil floorboard smell comfort nostalgic incense note smoky balsamic freshness pine leave drag priest censer chapel forest clearing scent worship yes worship altar nature picture ancient warrior cooking heavily spice meat fire surround howl ice wind hindu kush get idea mysterious alchemy culinary spiritual play think nothing quite like
aenotus parfum extrait,Puredistance," On a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of Aeolia, a mythic God tends to the divine winds. At a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient Europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction.

tabac eau de parfum,La Via Del Profumo," Tobacco fragrances often get the weight' thing wrong. Too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. Tabac by Abdes Salaam Attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. The tobacco leaf in Tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. Its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. As you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. But fear not! The resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. Tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. It's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. In a word  suave."," tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",tobacco fragrance often get weight thing wrong much amber vanilla sink heft richness light feel like sheer wash ash skin tabac abde salaam attar get right pair bold tobacco leaf sheer driedfruit amber bitter earthy vanilla element serve modulate behavior sidestep excessive sweetness tobacco leaf tabac raw uncured even bit rough around edges honesttogoodness rustic charm complement quasianimalic woodiness sticky black vanilla pod buttery cherryalmond bitterness tonka bean may imagine result incredibly rich fear not resinous amber underpinning tobacco vanilla tonka bean crown dry no danger tip syrup tabac simply vigorous handsome wellbuilt perfect midweight tobacco perfume substantial enough satisfy spacious enough wear without feel crush weight superrich material word suave

cuir mauresque eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Each release of Serge Lutens' Palais-Royale exclusives into the export line is an eagerly awaited event and with this season's Cuir Mauresque, aficionados will, at last, be able to revel in the definitive Oriental leather, in the line of Caron's mythical Tabac Blond with spices added.This isn't the tough, rawhide pungency rising from Marrakech tanneries, but the smoothest, fatty-rich leather rubbed in flowers and a sweet spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and clove infused with the fragrant smoke of incense and myrrh rising from censers. Sweetened by orange blossom, mandarin peel and amber, Cuir Mauresque gives off a tawny, ember-like glow. The leather accord itself is produced by burnt styrax, a balsamic material with tarry, animalic facets; clove, incense and aloe wood add a dark, burnt edginess to the accord, while civet pulls it towards the animal.With its spiced dried fruit accord, resins and white flowers, Cuir Mauresque, originally launched in 1996, is perhaps the quintessential Lutens: the master himself has gone on record saying he doused himself in on the rare occasions when he goes out.  And considering the choice he's got, that's saying quite a lot. What We Think Spicy, powdery, and animalic, this is a delightfully sexy secret weapon of a fragrance."," amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom",release serge lutens palaisroyale exclusives export line eagerly await event season cuir mauresque aficionados last able revel definitive oriental leather line caron mythical tabac blond spice add not tough rawhide pungency rise marrakech tannery smooth fattyrich leather rub flower sweet spice blend cinnamon nutmeg cumin clove infuse fragrant smoke incense myrrh rise censer sweeten orange blossom mandarin peel amber cuir mauresque give tawny emberlike glow leather accord produce burn styrax balsamic material tarry animalic facet clove incense aloe wood add dark burn edginess accord civet pull towards animal spice dry fruit accord resin white flower cuir mauresque originally launch 1996 perhaps quintessential lutens master go record say douse rare occasion go consider choice get say quite lot think spicy powdery animalic delightfully sexy secret weapon fragrance
chene eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," If you thought the oak, beeswax and rum notes would take you in Uncle Serge's secret Western-style den  the one with the polished heirloom furniture where he trades mint tea for a tipple  you'd be very much mistaken...  ChÃªne is quintessentially Lutens: dried fruit, spices and wood.In ChÃªne (French for oak), each note seems to mesh with the others to create a flammable mixture drenched in woody saps and resins... The fruity booziness of the oak, rum and immortelle segues, through the latter's tobacco and honey notes, into the beeswax and tonka bean. The smokiness of the tonka bean echoes that of the birch tar and oak. The bone-dry, pencil-shavings cedar is suffused with the aromatic camphor of the black thyme and the underlying bitterness of the oak tannins is nestled in anundergrowth note which chypre aficionados will recognize as... oak moss. In fact, ChÃªne is probably the closest Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake have come to composing an aromatic leather chypre, in their trademark oriental-style. What We Think Rich, woodsy, and delightfully long lasting, this is a masterpiece for any cedar lovers."," cedar crystals, wood sap, black thyme, oak, immortelle, beeswax, silver birch, rum absolute and tonka bean",think oak beeswax rum note would take uncle serge secret westernstyle den one polished heirloom furniture trade mint tea tipple would much mistaken chaane quintessentially lutens dry fruit spice wood chaane french oak note seem mesh create flammable mixture drench woody saps resin fruity booziness oak rum immortelle segue latter tobacco honey note beeswax tonka bean smokiness tonka bean echo birch tar oak bonedry pencilshaving cedar suffuse aromatic camphor black thyme underlie bitterness oak tannins nestled anundergrowth note chypre aficionados recognize oak moss fact chaane probably close serge lutens christopher sheldrake come composing aromatic leather chypre trademark orientalstyle think rich woodsy delightfully long last masterpiece cedar lover

It can't be too much of a stretch to envision Fumerie Turque as Serge Lutens' tribute to Caron's trailblazing Tabac Blond  albeit with his trademark Oriental twist.Smokey wisps of honeyed, fruity tobacco rise from a smooth, vanilla-flavored blend of tonka bean, styrax and Peru balsam, conjuring lazy winter afternoons smoking a hookah and nibbling rose-scented Turkish delights in a leather-paneled room. The rich, floral, faintly animal odor of beeswax rises from floors strewn with ornate rugs and polished daybeds. The scent of late-blooming jasmine wafts up from the palace gardens. Through the intricate wooden lace of a musharabieh, the Bosphorus glints in the sunset. Intoxicating and comforting, Fumerie Turque is the ultimate Orientalist reverie in a bottle. Succumb.

de profundis eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord! Inspired in part by Psalm 130, De Profundis is a love poem to resurrection, both of the soul and of nature. This fragrance opens on a thrilling note of new plant growth pushing rudely through wet soil, ripping its way into the weak sunshine. A haze of violets, chrysanthemums, muguet, and hyacinth chills the wearer like a dawn mist, creating a floral harmony so beautiful and so delicate that one is afraid it will collapse at any moment.It doesn't. The metallic, green, and watery aromas of emerging plant life are grounded by the earthier, velvety notes of soil and violet petals. The end result is a perfume that manages to suggest new life while remaining ever so slightly wistful and melancholic in tone. In the base, the ethereal florals are wreathed in smoke, incense, and earth, a reminder of our own eventual return to the ground.Serge Lutens' exclusive Palais Royal line is now available in a travel atomizer set that includes a metal case, two 30ml refills (for a total of 60ml of juice), and a funnel.

sorong eau de parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the smooth, contemplative smoke of olibanum incense and the bright, luminous smoke of Indonesian kyara wood oud chips, Sorong is a grand vision of a mystical plane where the spiritual and supernatural collide.

Together, the potency of these materials is undeniable, and yet the effect is soothing, lending the wearer an aura of deep calm and protection.

chameleon eau de parfum,Zoologist," Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs  an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows.

dodo eau de parfum,Zoologist," The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly from their nests, the birds waddled through the sea of luscious ferns that carpeted the forest floor, to feast on fat, ripe berries. For generations, the island paradise of Mauritius nurtured the dodos, its predator-free and bountiful shores lulling them into a state of such complacency that even their wings grew idle, and flight was lost  even to memory. Ultimately their evolution would betray them cruelly, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort. It's only appropriate, therefore, that Zoologist Dodo is as laid-back a fougere as you'll ever encounter- an ultra-fresh, green, delightfully whimsical blend of fruit, flower and moss that may just lull you into a sublime state of relaxation. Dodo opens with an invigorating burst of tart lime and juicy berries, inviting you to venture deep into a forest dense with vibrant ferns. Delicate fiddleheads unfurl to reveal tendrils of feathery musk, as rosy florals float up to embrace them. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic and iconic, yet eerily unknowable and endlessly fascinating. The ideal fougere for those with an eclectic sensibility, who crave a life of leisure and contentment."," Fern, Lime, Lychee, Raspberry, Ambergris, Fir Balsam, Geranium, Rose, Amber, Feathery Musk, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Sandalwood",sun sparkle across ripple wave morning dance upon indian ocean rouse dodos carefree slumber stumble drunkenly nest bird waddle sea luscious fern carpet forest floor feast fat ripe berry generation island paradise mauritius nurture dodos predatorfree bountiful shore lulling state complacency even wing grow idle flight lose even memory ultimately evolution would betray cruelly last dodos enjoyed existence mark ease comfort appropriate therefore zoologist dodo laidback fougere ever encounter ultrafresh green delightfully whimsical blend fruit flower moss may lull sublime state relaxation dodo open invigorate burst tart lime juicy berry invite venture deep forest dense vibrant fern delicate fiddleheads unfurl reveal tendril feathery musk rosy floral float embrace dodo paradox like extinct inhabitant mauritius scent classic iconic yet eerily unknowable endlessly fascinating ideal fougere eclectic sensibility crave life leisure contentment

patiala extrait,Thameen," Created by Cartier in 1928 for an Indian Maharaja, the Patiala Necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery.  Containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. To this day, the disappearance has never been explained. In this spirit of opulence and mystery, Thameen presents Patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. Patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond.

vanilla shot eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," The first of the Sepia Collection, a bold trio of Parfum Extraits from legendary perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, Vanilla Shot is an extraordinary scent.

bakhoor,Montale," Born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the Middle East, a Bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a Mabkhara. The resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. As a perfume, Bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. For those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss Bakhoor."," Oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",bear ancient tradition nomadic tribe middle east bakhoor unique take fragrant smoke wood chip soak special recipe different person scent oil resin slowly burn vessel know mabkhara result scent no two identical always rich smoky sweet woodsy think purify relax even treat traditional malady perfume bakhoor draws long history tradition deliver raw exotic scent feel equally contemplative seductive rich resin sandalwood oud leather love smoky sophisticated sensual scent touch outofordinary not miss bakhoor
leather patchouli eau de parfum,Montale," Let's get one thing clear- Leather Patchouli is not a gourmand scent. After all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. You'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as Leather Patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. The result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear."," Leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",let us get one thing clear leather patchouli not gourmand scent deliver titular promise deliver rich robust oriental deep tone earthy patchouli smooth masculine leather would forgive not realize first sniff though leather patchouli combine complimentary note may expect labdanum oud cedarwood delectable blend white musk vanilla saffron balance richness main ingredient smooth sweetness accentuate natural gourmand aspect patchouli without ever venture sugar syrup territory result dynamic scent rugged enough satisfy macho taste smooth enough sport elegant evening wear
amber musk eau de parfum,Montale," Montale, admittedly, is not known for subtlety- their bold perfumes wear their powerful Middle Eastern influences proudly, and as a result have become beloved of those craving fragrances of beastly projection and sillage. But that doesn't mean the venerable Parisian house doesn't do subtle from time to time, and the latest example- the warm, mysterious,  Amber Musk- may be their best skin scent yet. Like a gentle caress, sweet, warm notes of amber glide tenderly above the skin, contrasting notes of clean powder against a soft, seductively musky current of animalic sensuality. It lingers on the skin for hours, leaving a trail of warm carnality in its wake, drawing those around you in ever closer. A true secret weapon if ever there was one, Amber Musk isn't like your typically beastly Montale scent- and it's all the sexier for it."," Sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar",montale admittedly not know subtlety bold perfumes wear powerful middle eastern influence proudly result become beloved craving fragrance beastly projection sillage not mean venerable parisian house not subtle time time late example warm mysterious amber musk may good skin scent yet like gentle caress sweet warm note amber glide tenderly skin contrast note clean powder soft seductively musky current animalic sensuality linger skin hour leave trail warm carnality wake draw around ever close true secret weapon ever one amber musk not like typically beastly montale scent sexier
mefisto gentiluomo eau de parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Mefisto Gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in Italy circa 1888. Like its progenitor, Mefisto, Gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery  clean  and makes it sexy again. Think the steamy aromas in a traditional Italian barbershop after a shave  triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. Yes, Gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.Right off the bat, Mefisto Gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. It wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. Salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel  not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. We're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. But if Mefisto Gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a Mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a Florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. The flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. Handsome, refined, and full of Italian braggadocio, Mefisto Gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018."," bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",mefisto gentiluomo name suggest gentlemans cologne compose style eaux de cologne use upscale barbershop joint italy circa 1888 like progenitor mefisto gentiluomo take seem become dirty word perfumery clean make sexy think steamy aromas traditional italian barbershop shave triplemille soap plush white towels 500 handmade leather loafer sweet creaminess sandalwood lotion massaged warm skin yes gentiluomo win day gorgeously luxuriously clean without lean cheap musks powder right bat mefisto gentiluomo playfully updates predecessor model brush bright salty citrus note icy mint burst bitter green leave wow basis natural mouthwateringly fresh smell salty lavender lend subtle ozonic feel not marine aquatic per se rather hillside leathery herbs brush sea air impress bubble sweetness float slightly candy citrus lavender note serve balance sharp note give polished modern vibe mefisto gentiluomo start maquis mediterranean hillside linger luxuriantly bright clean atmosphere traditional barbershop ultimately come rest milieu florentine artisans workshop scent suede mingle companionably patina centuriesold wood flower contribute softness texture iris stand bathing aromatics spectral glow handsome refined full italian braggadocio mefisto gentiluomo fresh barbershop fougere hide creamy floralcitrus core pull 1888 right 2018
uden overdose parfum,Xerjoff," Who says perfection can't be improved upon? Though the name Uden Overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original Uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. How does it differ, you ask? Well, while Uden Overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original  the essence of its fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of Uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. Both are utterly charming in their different ways. But if original Uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, Uden Overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay.  Uden Overdose opens similarly to Uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. But while original Uden turns creamy with vanilla, Uden Overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. Think a tannic Earl Grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. It smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. Tobacco blossom plays a central role in Uden Overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. Woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. This one's such a pleasure to wear. If you love fougeres (and the original Uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then Uden Overdose is your man."," Bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",say perfection not improve upon though name uden overdose imply scent simply strong version original uden scent distinct personality deserve take term differ ask well uden overdose retain wonderfully aromatic brightness original essence fougere character swap gourmand creaminess uden booze vanilla lavender dry toastiness spice hay woody amber utterly charming different ways original uden fougere feel tempt eat uden overdose fougere want roll around like would pile new mown hay uden overdose open similarly uden burn comet bright aromatic sharpness bergamot lemon original uden turn creamy vanilla uden overdose steer immediately dry spicy track blaze ginger root give citrus thrillingly hot dirty underbite think tannic earl grey tea liberally spike grate ginger smell masculine clean dry nary hint sugar cream around edges tobacco blossom play central role uden overdose green haylike tone give gingery citrus tea rustic edge reminiscent herbs wildflower baking hot sun woody amber musks apply judicious restraint base thickening sweeten scent never disturb smooth aromatic flow scent trajectory one pleasure wear love fougere original uden want woodsy spicy take give plenty option uden overdose man
colognise extrait de cologne,Nishane," In Turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent.

A sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once.

oud for greatness eau de parfum,Initio Parfums," The concept ofsacred geometry,  the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness,  is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large,  transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It's a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive.

red square eau de parfum,Mad et Len," Red is the color of passion, of warning, of danger. And what can we say? We hate to be all matchy-matchy', but Red Square sure lives up to its name! It scoops up some of the fieriest red' notes in perfumery, like red pepper, red musk, clove or cinnamon, and padauk wood, an African rosewood, and whips them up into a hot blaze, cooling them down again with ash and aromatics for a never-ending dance of hot and cold that holds the wearer's attention throughout. Key to Red Square's exciting aroma is nar (meaning fire' in Arabic), a rare red Boswellia sacra frankincense from Oman that has a fresh, spicy pine-like aroma pitched halfway between elemi and cinnamon bark. The opening is a column of white smoke billowing from a censer where elemi resin burns over eucalyptus branches, liquid tar, and cloves, its trail purified by an antiseptic ginger note. We love the minty, camphoraceous aspect of the incense, because it injects a leafy bitterness. Before we get too comfortable, however, Red Square plunges everything into a bath of hot pitch, like Eau Lente poured into the La Brea tar pits. This gutsy move is what transforms what could have been just a nice incense scent into something mesmerizingly different. The scent continues on in this spiced, musky tar-like track for a while before smoothing out into a peppery incense accord that reminds us of the aldehydic coldness of Avignon (Comme des Garcons) or LAVS (UNUM). We recommend Red Square to anyone who thinks that incense no longer holds any surprises. Although it riffs off the bone structure of some of the greats, Red Square takes us in some new and surprising directions."," padauk wood, red frankincense, musk",red color passion warning danger say hate matchymatchy red square sure life name scoop fieriest red note perfumery like red pepper red musk clove cinnamon padauk wood african rosewood whip hot blaze cool ash aromatics neverending dance hot cold hold wearer attention throughout key red square exciting aroma nar meaning fire arabic rare red boswellia sacra frankincense oman fresh spicy pinelike aroma pitch halfway elemi cinnamon bark opening column white smoke billow censer elemi resin burns eucalyptus branch liquid tar clove trail purify antiseptic ginger note love minty camphoraceous aspect incense inject leafy bitterness get comfortable however red square plunge everything bath hot pitch like eau lente pour la brea tar pit gutsy move transform could nice incense scent something mesmerizingly different scent continue spice musky tarlike track smooth peppery incense accord remind us aldehydic coldness avignon comme des garcon lavs unum recommend red square anyone think incense no long hold surprise although riff bone structure great red square take us new surprising direction
noir encens eau de parfum,Mad et Len," Noir Encens is based on the scent of Mad et Len's beautiful Noir Encens potpourri  little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils  as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 No. XLIII Encens. The 2018 Noir Encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing High Mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. The almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. One thing is for sure, though: Noir Encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. Smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. If you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as FÃ¨ve DÃ©licieuse by Dior PrivÃ©e, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, or Le Baiser du Dragon by Cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on Mad et Len's 2018 Noir Encens."," amber, frankincense, tonka bean",noir encen base scent mad et lens beautiful noir encen potpourri little nuggets resin wood soak frankincense essential oil well smoky balsamic incense early release 2010 no xliii encen 2018 noir encen take austere frankincense oil original thickens powdery tonka bean velvety amber rich booziness amaretto thus replace high mass coziness fireside cold winter night book hand cat lap almondy heft tonka bean bitter cherryamaretto sense bitter sweet marzipan sense sweet perfectly balance never quite sure whether smell poison cure one thing sure though noir encen far sensual incense scent right smell trigger desire hibernate bite someone neck careful drive distraction balsamic smoky nigh edible sexiness fragrance fa dalicieuse dior privae hypnotic poison dior le baiser du dragon carti not afford miss mad et lens 2018 noir encen

and the world is yours extrait de parfum,A Lab on Fire," Few photographs capture the sumptuousness of celebrity more than the iconic photograph of Faye Dunaway by famed English photographer Terry O'Neill. The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?And the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice.

but not today extrait de parfum,UNUM," UNUM's But Not Today is named for that chilling moment in Silence of the Lambs when Dr. Hannibal Lecter sniffs Clarice Starling and leers,You use Evian skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. But Not Today is UNUM's scented capsule of the tension of that moment, where the pearly innocence of L'Air du Temps' carnation and lily, as worn by the fresh-faced Clarice Starling, faces off against the depraved bloodlust of castoreum, blood, and metal knives slicing through air, as represented by Hannibal himself. But Not Today's bloodcurdling mix of sweet indoles with blood, dust, and metal makes for an unsettling but strangely beautiful wear. But Not Today would be a great choice for anyone who prefers smelling interesting to merely pretty. Past the animalic roar of the bloody leather at the start, the scent develops into a spicy-floral gourmand that combines the culinary herb-and-spice-rack of Italian perfumery with creamy white flowers, freshened with the peppery greenness of lily. The powdery carnation that emerges in the base gives the scent an alluring old school' vibe redolent of the spicy leather drydowns of Caron's Tabac Blonde and En Avion. But Not Today is therefore that rare bird - possessed of both an avant-garde and retro character, but dominated by neither. But Not Today smells unique and doesn't compare easily to other fragrances. However, if you love scents such as Eva Kant by O'Driu, Vierges et Toreros by Etat Libre d'Orange, and Noun by Bogue, cut with the retro spice powder of L'Air du Temps and Tabac Blond, then waste no time in getting your nose on But Not Today."," Metal, lily, jasmine, leather, castoreum, carnation, animal notes",unum not today name chilling moment silence lamb dr hannibal lecter sniff clarice starle leersyou use evian skin cream sometimes wear lair du temp not today not today unum scent capsule tension moment pearly innocence lair du temp carnation lily wear freshfaced clarice starle face depraved bloodlust castoreum blood metal knife slice air represent hannibal not today bloodcurdle mix sweet indole blood dust metal make unsettling strangely beautiful wear not today would great choice anyone prefer smell interesting merely pretty past animalic roar bloody leather start scent develop spicyfloral gourmand combine culinary herbandspicerack italian perfumery creamy white flower freshen peppery greenness lily powdery carnation emerge base give scent alluring old school vibe redolent spicy leather drydown caron tabac blonde en avion not today therefore rare bird possess avantgarde retro character dominate neither not today smell unique not compare easily fragrance however love scent eva kant odriu vierges et toreros etat libre dorange noun bogue cut retro spice powder lair du temp tabac blond waste no time get nose not today
l'heure exquise 2020 extrait de parfum,Bortnikoff," Spring in Paris has almost become summer today. The shades of evening begin to descend. You sit in a cafe in the city center and look at the Seine. The sun goes down and the colors of the day mix with the purple sky. The familiar outlines of objects are faded by pastel tones, your eyes rest, and your feelings become stronger. The waiter brings you a cup of cocoa and a dessert. Dusky air cools your face and you feel the richness of scents brighter than ever before: the beverage, the food and a bouquet of flowers nearby. It is L'heure Exquise. The fragrance starts with a soft mix of Cardamom and Citruses. In a moment you get into a whirlpool of spicy notes of Cocoa, Clove and Myrrh. The heart of the fragrance beats with floral notes of exotic Champaca and Jasmine.

i am trash eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Put aside the marketing for a minute - no, I Am Trash (or Les Fleurs du DÃ©chet) does not smell like trash! Etat Libre d'Orange is a brand known for making high concept art, and this is no exception. In I Am Trash, the idea is to raise awareness about the continued usefulness of the things that normally get thrown away, and find a way to upcycle these items to create something beautiful in its own right. I Am Trash is a perfume made entirely from found objects' like the fruit peels and wood chips leftover from extraction by the perfume or food industry. This makes perfect sense. After all, some of the most exquisite materials in perfumery derive from waste. Ambergris, for example, is effluvia from a whale washed up on a beach. Oud is a tree's white cell response to a fungal infection. And so on and so forth. But fear not, for I Am Trash is as far from the ruder, dirtier aspects of nature's waste as you can imagine. It is a gentle fruity-floral that wraps a woodland bouquet of wild strawberries, apple, rose, and citrus rind up in a frothy musk and asks you to forgive it its dramatic back story. Nothing dark or rotting lurks in the corners. This is a purely bright, sunny concoction of fruits and flowers, with clean musks, radiant Iso E Super, and a dab of creamy sandalwood in the base pinning it all together. Etat Libre d'Orange could have named this I Am Joy and nobody would blink. But we love the name I Am Trash because it's a reminder to be more thoughtful about what we throw away, and testament to the fact that, sometimes, out of trash comes true beauty."," bitter orange, apple, lemongrass, tangerine, rose, Iso E Super, wild strawberry, Atlas cedar, Sandalore, Akigalawood",put aside marketing minute no trash les fleur du dachet not smell like trash etat libre dorange brand know make high concept art no exception trash idea raise awareness continue usefulness thing normally get throw away find way upcycle item create something beautiful right trash perfume make entirely find object like fruit peel wood chip leftover extraction perfume food industry make perfect sense exquisite material perfumery derive waste ambergris example effluvia whale wash beach oud tree white cell response fungal infection forth fear not trash far ruder dirtier aspect nature waste imagine gentle fruityfloral wraps woodland bouquet wild strawberry apple rise citrus rind frothy musk ask forgive dramatic back story nothing dark rot lurks corner purely bright sunny concoction fruit flower clean musks radiant iso e super dab creamy sandalwood base pin together etat libre dorange could name joy nobody would blink love name trash reminder thoughtful throw away testament fact sometimes trash come true beauty
noble xxi cypress parfum,Clive Christian," Clive Christian Cypress is a beautifully-made masculine that manages to capture the magic of a French Riviera night, where the spicy greenness of the breeze sweeping through tall cypress trees mingles with the effervescence of freshly-poured champagne. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda boozing it up in a citrus grove in Nice, the tinkle of laughter and light jazz floating on the warm night air, and that's the mood board right there for the scent. The opening to Cypress is surprisingly spicy, thick with cloves, cinnamon, ginger root, and the anisic mintiness of fresh basil. But it's also immensely fresh and sour, a lively undercurrent of tart bergamot playing off the green bitterness of cypress. Fans of the balsamic soapiness of Jaipur Homme will recognize echoes in Cypress, but where the Boucheron burrows deep into an opoponax base, Cypress swerves into an elegant essay on the dry richness of woods. In the base, a handsome pairing of oakwood and cedarwood knits together a rich weave of smoke, toasted wood, and spice until you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. In the far reaches of the scent, rich amber swells up to thicken the woods, adding weight but not sweetness. If anyone is feeling short-changed by the dearth in good masculines these days, then point them in the direction of Clive Christian Cypress  they won't be disappointed."," petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar",clive christian cypress beautifullymade masculine manage capture magic french riviera night spicy greenness breeze sweep tall cypress tree mingle effervescence freshlypoure champagne think f scott fitzgerald zelda boozing citrus grove nice tinkle laughter light jazz float warm night air mood board right scent opening cypress surprisingly spicy thick clove cinnamon ginger root anisic mintiness fresh basil also immensely fresh sour lively undercurrent tart bergamot play green bitterness cypress fan balsamic soapiness jaipur homme recognize echo cypress boucheron burrow deep opoponax base cypress swerve elegant essay dry richness wood base handsome pair oakwood cedarwood knits together rich weave smoke toast wood spice not tell one ends begin far reach scent rich amber swells thicken wood add weight not sweetness anyone feel shortchanged dearth good masculine day point direction clive christian cypress not disappointed
champ de fleurs eau de cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Anne Flipo revisits of one of her most influential perfumes: 1999's La Chasse Aux Papillons. An impossibly soft, transparent tuberose that spells out spring in capital letters. In Champ de Fleurs, Flipo keeps the airy white floral in place, but takes it in a new and interesting direction. First, she freshens the topnotes with bitter grapefruit and a juicy pear note, giving the floral heart an icy morning dew' feel. Second, perhaps more significantly, she bolsters the airy tuberose with a creamy, full-fat pairing of gardenia and jasmine, so that the contrast between the fresh eau de cologne-style notes in the opening and the buttery floral heart feels even more dramatic. Velvety, creamy, and hovering somewhere between suggestive and innocent, Champ de Fleurs lingers on the skin and in the air for hours. It melts into the muskiness of your own skin, forming an aura that will leave people wondering if you're perfumed or have just been luxuriating in a long, steamy bath with honey and milk soap. Like La Chasse Aux Papillons and Chanel Beige, Champ de Fleurs is suggestive of springtime meadows but in an abstract, impressionistic way  you smell the gardenia, the tuberose, and the crisp green muguet not as a living, breathing flower per se, but as a gently creamy floral watercolor that swirls all the colors together. Unabashedly feminine, we see Champ de Fleurs as the perfect choice for those who prefer a discreetly luxurious symphony of spring flowers over the loud, fleshy sexiness of a tuberose or gardenia solo."," grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedar, musk, amber",anne flipo revisit one influential perfumes 1999s la chasse aux papillon impossibly soft transparent tuberose spell spring capital letter champ de fleur flipo keep airy white floral place take new interesting direction first freshens topnote bitter grapefruit juicy pear note give floral heart icy morning dew feel second perhaps significantly bolster airy tuberose creamy fullfat pair gardenia jasmine contrast fresh eau de colognestyle note opening buttery floral heart feel even dramatic velvety creamy hover somewhere suggestive innocent champ de fleur linger skin air hour melt muskiness skin form aura leave people wonder perfumed luxuriating long steamy bath honey milk soap like la chasse aux papillon chanel beige champ de fleur suggestive springtime meadow abstract impressionistic way smell gardenia tuberose crisp green muguet not live breathing flower per se gently creamy floral watercolor swirls color together unabashedly feminine see champ de fleur perfect choice prefer discreetly luxurious symphony spring flower loud fleshy sexiness tuberose gardenia solo

love & crime eau de parfum,Ex Idolo," In 1905, a lovestruck young woman named Mazie Coyle devised a scheme to break her fiancee out of prison that would later become legendary- a hacksaw baked into a wedding cake. It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break."," Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake",1905 lovestruck young woman name mazie coyle devise scheme break fiancee prison would later become legendary hacksaw baked wedding cake escapade would win heart nation culminate joyous acquittal charge celebrate love ingenuity pleasure nonviolently thumb one nose system ex idolo present love crime delightfully bright floral gourmand sass style spare scent deceptively simple bold lusciously romantic blend rich vanilla white floral smooth creamy mouthwatere however like famous cake world secret hide beneath frost vibrant note red mandarin shine opening bestowing fruity brightness richly sugar exterior cut cake treat indulgent butteriness though surprisingly dark subtle note cocoa hint illicit surprise within make no mistake thing never take challenge turn like coyle escape tale mean charm delight love crime accomplishe goal deftly perfectly time prison break
dark lord eau de parfum,By Kilian," Dangerously sophisticated, Dark Lord is both a fragrance of impeccable manners and seductive wickedness. It's a scent for gentlemen and scoundrels alike, both bold and subtle, constructed around a rich, gorgeous extract of raw Haitian vetiver and an intriguing blend of fruit-inflected, bright Sichuan pepper and electric bourbon pepper, smoothed behind a refined facade of leather and rum. Each supporting note- spicy, sweet, boozy, smooth, and earthy- coaxes out a corresponding facet of the vetiver, resulting in a men's fragrance with impressive versatility- in an office, worn with a sensible suit, it exudes suave, dignified elegance, while simultaneously adding a dangerous allure to a night out on the town- exactly what Kilian Hennessy had in mind from the beginning. Sure, you're just a regular, mild-mannered guy- but with a dash of Dark Lord, you can be so much more."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli",dangerously sophisticated dark lord fragrance impeccable manners seductive wickedness scent gentleman scoundrel alike bold subtle construct around rich gorgeous extract raw haitian vetiver intriguing blend fruitinflecte bright sichuan pepper electric bourbon pepper smooth behind refined facade leather rum support note spicy sweet boozy smooth earthy coaxes correspond facet vetiver result men fragrance impressive versatility office wear sensible suit exude suave dignified elegance simultaneously add dangerous allure night town exactly kilian hennessy mind begin sure regular mildmannere guy dash dark lord much
princesses de malabar eau de parfum,Lubin," Legends tell of the mythical Princesses of the Malabar coast of western India, wise women who ruled their kingdom with wisdom and equanimity; in the 18th century, their tale became a shorthand for gracious, fair, female leadership. Now, in a time where that quality is disappointingly ephemeral, Lubin delivers a fragrance meant to inspire and enchant a new generation of empowered women. Bursting with fruity-floral energy that floats into a gorgeously weightless cloud of powdery musk, Princesses of Malabar is a bridge between past and present, a thoroughly modern and delightful feminine scent with an undeniable link to the glamorous perfumes of centuries past. Princesses of Malabar opens with the dynamic sparkle of aldehydes and citrus, a bathing light that cleanses palette and soul to make way for the rich but never-heavy fruity floral base- a juicy spritz of peach, the sumptuous lushness of magnolia, the sexy-sweet combination of jasmine and ylang. It's every bit as fun and youthful as the latest mass market blockbuster, only a thousand times more sophisticated. The contrast is only heightened in the vintage-inspired base, which deploys the powdery strength of iris atop a pillow-soft confection of amber, musk, and tonka, flirting with the mouthwatering appeal of a gourmand while never tipping into over-sugared dessert territory. It's a sublime formula, as fun as it is formal, as sweet as it is smooth, as fresh as it is fancy- a 21st century feminine scent for the young at heart and old souls alike. We could all use a bit of royal inspiration in these trying times, and Princesses de Malabar seems destined to become a new classic."," Cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, Arabian jasmine, Nosy Be ylang ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean",legends tell mythical princess malabar coast western india wise woman rule kingdom wisdom equanimity 18th century tale become shorthand gracious fair female leadership time quality disappointingly ephemeral lubin deliver fragrance mean inspire enchant new generation empower woman burst fruityfloral energy float gorgeously weightless cloud powdery musk princess malabar bridge past present thoroughly modern delightful feminine scent undeniable link glamorous perfumes century past princess malabar open dynamic sparkle aldehyde citrus bathing light cleanse palette soul make way rich neverheavy fruity floral base juicy spritz peach sumptuous lushness magnolia sexysweet combination jasmine ylang every bit fun youthful late mass market blockbuster thousand time sophisticated contrast heighten vintageinspire base deploys powdery strength iris atop pillowsoft confection amber musk tonka flirt mouthwatere appeal gourmand never tip oversugare dessert territory sublime formula fun formal sweet smooth fresh fancy 21st century feminine scent young heart old soul alike could use bit royal inspiration try time princess de malabar seem destine become new classic
liquid illusion eau de parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Liquid Illusion opens with such a lush, fruity almond note that we instantly picture Marie Antoinette wearing it, giggling with girlfriends as she nibbles on pastel-colored petit fours.  It's over-the-top delicious. Heliotrope, the tiny purple flower that smells like cherries and marzipan, ramps up the nutty gourmandise of this opening, but also ushers in a tart floral freshness that breathes air into the rafters. But Liquid Illusion is not just a fluffy gourmand delight (although it's certainly that, too). After a while, you become aware of the scaffolding beneath, with its complex system of cantilevers designed to keep those almond topnotes aloft. In particular, iris absolute, its shy aroma strengthened and made incredibly diffusive by irone and iracine (iris root oil compounds), casts a berried, violety forcefield around the scent. Tuberose absolute shows up, but comes armed with a girlish bubblegum nuance rather than its usual full desk of indole and rubber. The mix of all these floral and fruit elements is irresistible because it teeters on the line between innocent and seductive, girlish and come-hither. Benzoin imparts a gritty, brown sugar texture to the base that will make you want to bite your arm, but the real stars are the creamy tonka bean and musks, back-up generators of real balsamic warmth. Liquid Illusion is just the thing for when things just feel really bleak; a floral that skips the usual arm's-length froideur of flowers and offers you delicious, seductive warmth instead."," Heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk",liquid illusion open lush fruity almond note instantly picture marie antoinette wear giggle girlfriend nibble pastelcolore petit four overthetop delicious heliotrope tiny purple flower smell like cherry marzipan ramps nutty gourmandise opening also usher tart floral freshness breathes air rafter liquid illusion not fluffy gourmand delight although certainly become aware scaffolding beneath complex system cantilever design keep almond topnote aloft particular iris absolute shy aroma strengthen make incredibly diffusive irone iracine iris root oil compound casts berried violety forcefield around scent tuberose absolute show come armed girlish bubblegum nuance rather usual full desk indole rubber mix floral fruit element irresistible teeter line innocent seductive girlish comehither benzoin impart gritty brown sugar texture base make want bite arm real star creamy tonka bean musks backup generator real balsamic warmth liquid illusion thing thing feel really bleak floral skips usual armslength froideur flower offer delicious seductive warmth instead
love tuberose eau de parfum,Amouage," Are you on a diet? Well, sorry, because Love Tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. Amouage's second installment in its Secret Garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. Eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, Love Tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more trÃ¨s leches cake. Picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. Honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. The Chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. Love Tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. An unabashedly feminine scent, Love Tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. But would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? No - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone."," tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",diet well sorry love tuberose destine weaken resolve amouage second installment secret garden series outrageously gourmand take one nature hotheade blooms tuberose eschew green vegetal rubbery indolic facet normally associated tuberose love tuberose instead play creamy sweetest buttery aspect sensuous flower arrive result less flower tra lech cake picture layer upon layer creamy white jasmine tuberose petal soak condense milk press 10layer white cake bound together ethereal gardenia buttercream honestly put not allow involuntary groan pleasure escape lip strong chantilly cream note delicious whip creaminess blur indolic thrust tuberose flower become feathersoft almost innocent love tuberose turn heat back though salty musky drydown wear like halo salty gardenia sunkissed skin sandalwood unabashedly feminine scent love tuberose pearlescent ivory bottle perfect mirror frothy layer tulle contain within would deny man slice white cake buttercream frost want no level deliciousness deserve experienced everyone
tonka 25 eau de parfum,Le Labo," Le Labo's first release in three years, we think Tonka 25 was worth the wait. An addictively dark and warm fragrance, Tonka 25 captures the humid funk of a forest's undergrowth, teeming with the buzz of insects, seeds, and resin. True to form for any Le Labo fragrance, tonka is a part of the composition but not the whole story. The crushed almond heft of tonka bean absolute is detectable in the background, where it infuses the perfume with aromatic woodsmoke, but for us, the real star of the show is the cedar, followed by musk and orange flower.The Atlas cedar in Tonka 25 is spicy, humid, and almost dank, creating an impression of woodrot that's enhanced by a swirl of vegetal musks. For a moment, we're reminded of the animalic topnote of Oud 27, but this is less alien, far more human: warm, enveloping, and very sexy. The furred darkness of the woods and musk at the heart of Tonka 25 holds sway for much of the scent's life, but we'd be remiss in not mentioning the extraordinary orange flower absolute. Orange blossom's gift to Tonka 25 is a green, waxy brightness that feels like a honey candle glowing through a knot of hemp. Finally, enter styrax resin, blessing the drydown with a leathery, smoky richness. If you're looking for something that will comfort and titillate in equal measure, then put Le Labo Tonka 25 on top of your test list. Dark woods expanded by creamy animalic musks, crushed tonka, and smoky resin, backlit by silky orange flower....a glowering Heathcliff in a bottle.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

ruby extrait parfum extrait,Bruno Acampora," 80 years ago, Nestle launched the first bar of white chocolate, bringing the number of naturally-colored chocolate in the world to 3: dark, milk, and white. But in 2017, after 13 straight years of research and development, Barry Callebaut, one of the world's most respected artisanal chocolate makers, decided that the world was ready for a fourth color  pink! Derived from a special cocoa bean, Ruby is a 100% naturally pink chocolate that possesses a uniquely sour, berry-like fruitiness not present in other types of chocolate. It was a breakthrough for the confectionary business worldwide  and for perfumery too. Bruno Acampora's Ruby is the world's first fragrance based on the scent and taste of this extraordinary pink chocolate. Please take our word for it  it's luscious. Ruby opens with sour cherries enrobed in melted dark chocolate, a hint of booze, rose, and coffee playing around the edges like a smile. Cleverly emulating the fruitiness of Ruby chocolate, the creaminess of the cocoa notes is imbued with a streak of either redcurrant or blackberry, so you get both the milky sweetness and the tongue-tickling sourness that makes pink chocolate so unique. But before you're tempted to stick your entire arm in your mouth (it's that delicious), the perfume finishes in a blaze of that earthy, semi-funky 1970's style musk for which the Acampora brand is famous.

percival eau de parfum,Parfums de Marly," Named for a mythical French thoroughbred, Percival is that rarest of wonders- a truly ageless masculine. Sure, we can picture a dashing racing horse thundering around an 18th century track to the delight of the aristocracy, but Percival is every bit as appropriate on a debonair gentleman in a pristine late-model luxury sedan, stylishly cutting his way through the bustling city night on his way to an exclusive gathering. With a subtle yet striking balance between citrus and aromatic notes, a richly masculine floral heart of lavender, violet and geranium, and a spiced, deeply woodsy base, this is the kind of scent that wears as perfectly on any man as an impeccably tailored three-piece suit- a timeless signifier of dignity and taste. Fresh, sensual and refined, Percival is bound to leave a lasting impression."," Bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka",name mythical french thoroughbred percival rare wonder truly ageless masculine sure picture dash racing horse thunder around 18th century track delight aristocracy percival every bit appropriate debonair gentleman pristine latemodel luxury sedan stylishly cut way bustling city night way exclusive gather subtle yet strike balance citrus aromatic note richly masculine floral heart lavender violet geranium spice deeply woodsy base kind scent wear perfectly man impeccably tailor threepiece suit timeless signifier dignity taste fresh sensual refined percival bound leave last impression
vetiverissimo eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Vetiverissimo is Bruno Fazzolari (now creating scents under the FZOTIC label) at his most stripped-back and personal; it's the vetiver he made for himself. Calming and Zen-like, this is the vetiver you wear to relax and clear your mind. No topnotes to speak of, and no back-story either  just a superb quality vetiver dusted with a hint of warming spice, bleeding gradually into a protracted woody drydown. Wearing Vetiverissimo feels like doing a factory re-set on your nerves. With its matte, earthen dustiness and subtle spice, it smells less like a Western perfume and more like Mitti Attar, a traditional Indian distillation of clay into sandalwood oil that captures the scent of rain on red soil. A flicker of turmeric or saffron gives the earthy vetiver a little kick, but doesn't interrupt the smooth Zen flow of the scent. On paper, the rooty greenness of the vetiver seems to last forever, but on skin, it slides quickly and seamlessly into the warm embrace of polished woods, a balanced tandem of aromatic sandalwood and spicy, resinous cedar. Drying down into a smoky powder hovering between sandalwood paste and zukoh (incense powder), Vetiverissimo is a laid-back ayurvedic salve for frazzled tempers and city stress. In fact, it's so good we think it should be prescribed by doctors."," spice, vetiver, cedar, resins, woods",vetiverissimo bruno fazzolari create scent fzotic label strippedback personal vetiver make calm zenlike vetiver wear relax clear mind no topnote speak no backstory either superb quality vetiver dust hint warm spice bleed gradually protract woody drydown wear vetiverissimo feel like factory reset nerve matte earthen dustiness subtle spice smell less like western perfume like mitti attar traditional indian distillation clay sandalwood oil capture scent rain red soil flicker turmeric saffron give earthy vetiver little kick not interrupt smooth zen flow scent paper rooty greenness vetiver seem last forever skin slide quickly seamlessly warm embrace polished wood balance tandem aromatic sandalwood spicy resinous cedar drying smoky powder hover sandalwood paste zukoh incense powder vetiverissimo laidback ayurvedic salve frazzle temper city stress fact good think prescribe doctor
lucid dream eau de parfum,Ex Idolo," Lucid Dream is an olfactory exploration of the semi meditative state in which a person is aware they are asleep but is able to control their surroundings, and an ode to the potential hidden in every one of us. Juxtaposing rich, bright notes of pink pepper and davana with smoky, meditative florals and incense, Lucid Dream truly feels like another plane of existence, an ethereal journey into a world where we follow our wildest artistic impulses and break through the creative blocks that may impede our waking lives. It's a vivid, yet ethereal, experience, simultaneously romantic and contemplative, with the outstanding ingredient quality and rich tonalities for which Ex Idolo is known. Will Lucid Dream make you a master of your own subconscious?

flash back in new york eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," What an interesting and original flanker! Like the fuzzy picture of a snowy New York avenue taken as its starting point, Flash Back in New York weaves rhubarb, apple, leather, and wood together so seamlessly that it's difficult to pick out the individual lines at first. But slowly, like the shape of a building or a person emerging from a blur of snowflakes, we are able to make out the earthiness of vetiver, its grey-brown smokiness illuminated in spots by the brightness of unripe fruit. If the scent begins in earth and fruit, it soon develops in a series of surprising directions that keep our interest engaged. One strand leads us off into a gently spicy tonka bean diversion, another into a smoky violet-and-saffron leather, and yet another into an aromatic woody finish. We especially love the contrast between the soft warmth of the cumin and tonka pushing against the milky coolness of the leather and papyrus. Just as in the original photo by Vivienne Gucwa, Flash Back in New York is all about the hard angles of light slicing through a fuzzy darkness. If you love either Santal 33 by Le Labo or Terre d'Hermes by Hermes but wish for a gentler, more diffuse take that's stunning on either a man or a woman, then try Flash Back in New York. Its woodsy, androgynous sexiness will appeal even to those who don't normally wear fragrance."," Cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, Tuscan leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean",interesting original flanker like fuzzy picture snowy new york avenue take start point flash back new york weave rhubarb apple leather wood together seamlessly difficult pick individual line first slowly like shape build person emerge blur snowflake able make earthiness vetiver greybrown smokiness illuminate spot brightness unripe fruit scent begin earth fruit soon develop series surprising direction keep interest engage one strand lead us gently spicy tonka bean diversion another smoky violetandsaffron leather yet another aromatic woody finish especially love contrast soft warmth cumin tonka push milky coolness leather papyrus original photo vivienne gucwa flash back new york hard angle light slice fuzzy darkness love either santal 33 le labo terre dherme hermes wish gentler diffuse take stunning either man woman try flash back new york woodsy androgynous sexiness appeal even not normally wear fragrance
woody mood eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," With Woody Mood, perfumer Betrand Duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall  crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire  compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. The inspiration for Woody Mood is Roger Steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a California redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. Since Duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (Timbuktu, Avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. Woody Mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. Aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. From the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. The contrast in Woody Mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. Like Au Coeur du Desert, Woody Mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. If you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by Olfactive Studio is a no-brainer."," bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",woody mood perfumer betrand duchaufour reach inside head pull fantasy fall crisp air sweet woodsmoke crackle leave hit bonfire compile autumnal essay satisfie bone inspiration woody mood roger steffenss 1973 photo woman wander alone california redwood forest shafts sunlight pierce gloom since duchaufour father perfume historys influential woodyincense scent timbuktu avignon etc make perfect sense perfumer choose translate photo fragrance form woody mood open buzz whiskeysoaked wood rich wet quickly dry ribbon pure woodsmoke wind lazily chill air aromatic sage spikenard give wood masculine swagger see scent work beautifully womans skin radiant blaze wood emerge core rubbery black tea cacao styrax darken scent point no long sure whether smell wood leather contrast woody mood peppery brightness wood darkness burn resin perfect mirror play light dark photo like au coeur du desert woody mood genius lie conjure vivid chiaroscuro restrict palette earth tone love radiant smokiness woodsmoke without additional weight amber cream scent olfactive studio nobrainer
kings wood fragrance concentree,Shay & Blue," Not in the least bit like Aventus! Just putting that out there (we're aware that pineapple is a trigger word for some). No, Kings Wood takes the oft-abused pineapple and sets it among aromatic herbs and greenery for a gentlemanly English garden fougÃ¨re that's mercifully low on sugar. It's clean, aromatic, and above all, unpretentious. We love it. Although the topnote is clearly pineapple, it has a thrilling tartness that leans more on grapefruit and tart greenery than tropical cocktail. Its fougÃ¨re bone structure really comes into focus once that big, handsome oak note settles in, shoring up all the peppery herbs and fruit with its broad shoulders. Tilted towards the masculine side of the scale, Kings Wood belongs on the confident titan of industry who secretly dreams of being back in his garden, potting plants and hacking back overgrown brambles. The leather accord in the far drydown is a delightful late addition, ruffling the elegant surface of this gentlemanly fougÃ¨re with a surprisingly skanky note redolent of animal hide and undergrowth. We see Kings Wood working fantastically on a man (or woman) who loves the rustic vigor of herbs, fruit, oak, and good clean dirt but needs it packaged up into an elegant structure for a conservative setting."," pineapple, fern, Sichuan pepper, oak, leather",not least bit like aventus put aware pineapple trigger word no king wood take oftabuse pineapple set among aromatic herbs greenery gentlemanly english garden fouga mercifully low sugar clean aromatic unpretentious love although topnote clearly pineapple thrill tartness leans grapefruit tart greenery tropical cocktail fouga bone structure really come focus big handsome oak note settle shore peppery herbs fruit broad shoulder tilt towards masculine side scale king wood belong confident titan industry secretly dream back garden pot plant hacking back overgrow bramble leather accord far drydown delightful late addition ruffle elegant surface gentlemanly fouga surprisingly skanky note redolent animal hide undergrowth see king wood work fantastically man woman love rustic vigor herbs fruit oak good clean dirt need package elegant structure conservative set
cuir celeste eau de parfum,Ex Nihilo," Does artistic talent transcend its medium? That's the question posed by Ex Nihilo's bold new Visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with Ex Nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. For the premiere of the series, they've teamed Ex Nihilo house perfumer Quentin Bisch with acclaimed photographer Mathieu Cesar, and the result is Cuir Celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality B&W print. Cuir Celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. The leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. The effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. If you love modern floral leather, don't miss Cuir Celeste- it's a work of art."," Black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",artistic talent transcend medium question pose ex nihilos bold new visionnaire series explore answer pair renowned visual artist ex nihilo perfumer help shape artistic conception actual scent premiere series teamed ex nihilo house perfumer quentin bisch acclaim photographer mathieu cesar result cuir celeste arrestingly modern surprisingly nuance leather scent vibrant contrast museumquality bw print cuir celeste open clean dry violet leaf accentuate quiet energy restrain black pepper note leather accord strike compelling balance gentle ambrettelaced floral bitter galbanum cypriol provide rich dry papyruslike base anchor spicy woodsy tone akigalawood effect modern smooth intriguing scent not much mimic actual aromas photography much smell way photograph look representation reality lens creator love modern floral leather not miss cuir celeste work art
eo no. 1 edp eau de parfum,Ensar Oud," When Ensar released Sultan Leather Attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. But to make an Eau de Parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. Still, the people were calling out for an EDP. And now, here we are. And what does an all-natural Ensar Oud EDP smell like? We're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr Kyaratul Mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild Hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from Sultan Qaboos's private collection. The results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding  romantic depth. There's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. A luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain Italian leather completes the vision.

Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. Smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust.

remember me eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," Remember Me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to Qatar that perfumer Cecile Zarokian took with Jovoy founder, Francois Henin. While in Doha, Cecile fell in love with the scent of Karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. Combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of Doha, Remember Me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents.  Combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, Remember Me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. Everything here is remarkably well balanced. The chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. In turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. You'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this  vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on  and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. But no, it's 100% unisex! Unusually, what pulls Remember Me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. Remember Me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. If you love unusual, complex sweet' fragrances such as El Born by Carner Barcelona and Leder 6 by J.F. Schwarzlose, then Remember Me might be your new obsession."," Bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",remember olfactory aidememoire inspire trip qatar perfumer cecile zarokian take jovoy founder francois henin doha cecile fall love scent karak local chai make lot lush sweet milk cardamom ginger steam mingle companionably exotic mukhallats bakhoor sampling combine wafts frangipani come shady avenue doha remember memory capsule exotic comfort scent combine edible element like milk vanilla chai less edible note leather wood remember modern sophisticated gourmand avoid make think directly food everything remarkably well balance chai peppery hot ginger calm generous pour steamy milk vanilla turn creaminess tea keep fresh duo bergamot cardamom thread scent like tart green ribbon would forgive look note vanilla frangipani milk assume purely feminine affair no 100 unisex unusually pull remember firmly center frangipani variety use smell like peachy suede tropical flower remember milky chai suede comfortably occupie meeting place gourmand oriental leather love unusual complex sweet fragrance el bear carner barcelona leder 6 jf schwarzlose remember may new obsession

santal nabataea eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at Petra, Jordan, Fredrik Dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century BC Nabataean Kingdom, for whom Petra was the capital city, back to life. A nomadic tribe by nature, Petra was a touchstone for the Nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. Santal Nabataea honors the inspiration of Petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in Petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. And wow, does it succeed. In exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, Santal Nabataea is that rare thing  a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. A pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. All the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal  the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. If it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling Santal Nabataea a priority. Featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from Australia as well as Indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal."," black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, Australian santalum album sandalwood, Indian sandalwood, coffee",inspire shift red pink cream layer sandstone petra jordan fredrik dalman want create perfume may bring memory 4th century bc nabataean kingdom petra capital city back life nomadic tribe nature petra touchstone nabataeans main focal point trade region santal nabataea honor inspiration petra two ways via reference exotic fruit spice trade petra time use certain material emulate dusty rosy color texture sandstone haunting city wow succeed explore dusty sometimes astringent heart true sandalwood rather famously creamy facet santal nabataea rare thing perfume smell genuinely exotic rather simply stuff many exotic note perfumer think paredback structure demonstrate confidence ability deliver message without unnecessary embellishment note exist showcase sandal black pepper create spicy darkness back throat coffee deepen masculine growl black currant leaf apricot note give tannic tealike nuance match wood astringency brusque aromatic dryness real sandalwood love make sampling santal nabataea priority feature sustainablysource santalum album australia well indian sandalwood rare real deal
tokyo eau de parfum,Gallivant," It's 6 am in Tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. As the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. Tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. Gallivant's Tokyo captures the moment when Old Tokyo meets New, the sweet smokiness of Japanese incense of Kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. There's a lot going on in Tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in Tokyo, the scent. But despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern Japanese urban culture. The exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. Tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. Japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. Before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. This might seem more Arabian-inspired than Japanese at first until you notice that the gentler Japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. Big city neon energy meets old world Tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect."," Yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",6 tokyo make way home quiet back street air humid early morning mist electric cable head crackle snap strange peace descend scene tokyo finally slumber least brief repose gather manic energy course city like pulse gallivant tokyo capture moment old tokyo meet new sweet smokiness japanese incense kodo ceremony spilling small wooden temple meet sweetandsour pungency izakaya street food lot go tokyo city lot go tokyo scent despite cacophony note meshes singular statement modern japanese urban culture exciting buzz yuzu black pepper topnote conjure crackle overhead electric cable swinge softly morning breeze wasabi cardamom nutmeg lend dash complex soursweet flavor brew tokyo smell intoxicate strange otherworldly way exposure completely foreign culture japanese temple incense calm center storm cloud gentle hinoki wood smoke damp flower petal billow street pass incense chance turn powder base exuberantlyspice amber patchouli sandalwood musk move drench scent gold patina orientalism may seem arabianinspired japanese first notice gentler japanese accent persist infiltrate fog resin aqueous sweetandsour aroma cardamom wasabi silvery ephemerality hinoki wood big city neon energy meet old world tokyo scent bring us straight point intersect

hemingway eau de parfum,Masque Milano," Masque Milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. So when they met IFF trainee Fanny Bal, apprenticing under the legendary Dominique Ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. And who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than Ernest Hemingway? With access to the full resources of the Laboratoire Monique Remy, Bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy Haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. Javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. And proprietary Vetiver Heart LMR, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance."," Ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart LMR, Haitian vetiver, Java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",masque milano gain wellearne reputation launch pad young talent brand take chance upandcoming nose give freedom discover creative voice meet iff trainee fanny bal apprenticing legendary dominique ropion hear facility ingenuity vetiver seed plant well dedicate scent build around vetiver rough spicy earthy sweet rich complex ernest hemingway access full resource laboratoire monique remy bal produce sweepingly literary tribute vetiver build exquisite vocabulary woody dry spicy haitian vetiver slight bitterness provide ideal contrast tart rhubarb opening javan vetiver dirtier smoky tone leathery facet blend patchouli leather base proprietary vetiver heart lmr take hydrodistilled vetiver put additional fractional distillation isolate clean dry heart grassy material without earthiness anchor heart fragrance

mizu eau de parfum,Di Ser," Mizu, meaning water in Japanese, combines zesty yuzu with spearmint for an aqua seltzer opening that feels like ice water running down your spine. It's the perfect palate cleanser, especially on stupid hot days when your brain seems to stop working. Although Mizu is technically a woody-aromatic citrus, you wouldn't mistake Mizu for a French or American eau de cologne. There's something intrinsically Japanese in its transparency, delicate sourness, and complex use of herbs. Mizu smells exotic, but subtly so. Moving effortlessly from its sparkling spearmint-and-yuzu topnotes to an earthy rosewood and vetiver base, its transitions are as smooth as flowing water. In the heart, it picks up a slight spiciness from the smattering of clovey pinks (carnations) and green cardamom, but it's a subtle accent rather than a plot point. Throughout, the tone is cool and astringent, the unami-rich rosewood and aromatics devoid of anything sweet or thickening. Mizu smells all-natural, because it is all-natural, but a Japanese lightness of touch keeps it from feeling muddy. Instead, Mizu wears like moonlight - peppery, silvery, and buoyant. We're kind of obsessed with this scent here at Luckyscent, because not only does it keep us feeling refreshed on turgid afternoons, but its balance of zesty brightness and earthy sourness keeps us engaged. It's that rare thing  an easy wear that's also whip smart."," Japanese yuzu (Citrus junos), spearmint, paper pink, cardamom, rosewood, vetiver",mizu meaning water japanese combine zesty yuzu spearmint aqua seltzer opening feel like ice water run spine perfect palate cleanser especially stupid hot day brain seem stop work although mizu technically woodyaromatic citrus would not mistake mizu french american eau de cologne something intrinsically japanese transparency delicate sourness complex use herbs mizu smell exotic subtly move effortlessly sparkle spearmintandyuzu topnote earthy rosewood vetiver base transition smooth flow water heart pick slight spiciness smatter clovey pink carnation green cardamom subtle accent rather plot point throughout tone cool astringent unamirich rosewood aromatics devoid anything sweet thickening mizu smell allnatural allnatural japanese lightness touch keep feel muddy instead mizu wear like moonlight peppery silvery buoyant kind obsess scent luckyscent not keep us feel refresh turgid afternoon balance zesty brightness earthy sourness keep us engage rare thing easy wear also whip smart

ruh eau de parfum,Pekji," Ruh, meaning spirit in Sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in Turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. Ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. And that's a rare feat. Ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. Roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the Turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. A blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. But the saffron is the real chameleon of Ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. Breathe in Ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, Turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. Yep, Ruh has soul. Luca Turin thought so too, awarding Ruh a 4 star rating in The Perfume Guide (2018)."," rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",ruh meaning spirit sanskrit collective scent airconditione souk turkey delicious aromas freshlyground coffee exotic spice incense mingle companionably scent rise attars open passersby ruh exotic unfamiliar manner rearranging traditionallyuse note like rise coffee cardamom way not make think every soukthemed oriental rare feat ruh rich not sweet heavy roast coffee crush green cardamom pod pump fragrant aromatic freshness scent cell give turkish rise spice wood character man love find easy wear blast fiery saffron nudge direction masculine wrapping lush rise fold freshlytanne leather saffron real chameleon ruh softens increment inky iodine gently spice milkiness kulfi turn scent dial dry lush breathe ruh close eye feel soul souk around redolent rich black coffee pile red saffron green cardamom turkish leather jacket tiny bottle rise attars open sniffed dab yep ruh soul luca turin think award ruh 4 star rating perfume guide 2018
zeybek extrait de parfum,Pekji," Zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive Aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. The way Zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. For us, Zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. Narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3D picture of a horse stall. The central flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. This thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. Engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call Zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. The only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention."," bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",zeybek take name expressive aegean dance solo male animalic fougere smell bit like minty chew gum breath cowboy rake horse stall way zeybek teeter precariously herbal freshness smeary funk whole way electrify plug live socket us zeybek revolve around handful key aromatics complex spin scent several direction narcissus yes innocent little daffodil exude fresh greenness cut stalk also facet soil hay civet jasmine create 3d picture horse stall central flower barnyard accord freshen top salty herbs lavender lemon effect smell like spearmint gum mixed sea water thrillingly odd combination rest equally odd base industrial note rubber gum putty shoot cigarette ash engage completely different anything ever smell would call zeybek animalic fougere resolutely modern naturalistic feel cost entry sense adventure refusal hem convention
odoon extrait de parfum,Pekji," A masterful treatise on a single material, Odoon takes us on a journey through the stored memory cells of a piece of wood, from the depths of the forest to the workshops, from sap to the burnt ashes in the grate of a fire. Odoon is wonderfully rich, balsamic, and warm  full of character and complexity despite its obsessive, almost singular focus.  The structure is remarkably uncluttered, focusing on exposing each facet of wood and turning it over for our attention. First, we smell the minty camphor of a freshly bladed log of wood, sap springing up as if startled by its sudden release. Then the roast coffee warmth of cedar, its peppery mealiness exposed to the air for the first time. Slowly, the wood dries out to the caramelic dryness of sandalwood awaiting the carver's tool, where it is polished to a high shine. It all comes together in a wisp of smoke and ash, nuggets of resin in the fine grain catching on fire here and there at the edges. Odoon is warm, deep symphony of wood notes that somehow transcends the simplicity of structure to take on a soul. If you love any of the Comme des Garcons woods-themed fragrances (Wonderwood, Sequoia, Hinoki, and so on), and want to see what a more natural, artisanal take smells like, then get yourself some Odoon."," ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla",masterful treatise single material odoon take us journey store memory cell piece wood depth forest workshop sap burn ashe grate fire odoon wonderfully rich balsamic warm full character complexity despite obsessive almost singular focus structure remarkably uncluttered focus expose facet wood turn attention first smell minty camphor freshly blade log wood sap springing startled sudden release roast coffee warmth cedar peppery mealiness expose air first time slowly wood dry caramelic dryness sandalwood await carver tool polished high shine come together wisp smoke ash nuggets resin fine grain catch fire edges odoon warm deep symphony wood note somehow transcend simplicity structure take soul love comme des garcon woodsthemed fragrance wonderwood sequoia hinoki want see natural artisanal take smell like get odoon
battaniye extrait de parfum,Pekji," Battaniye, meaning blanket in Turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. Well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. But to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. Because, although undeniably rich and comforting, Battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles  wool, leather, silk  than it does dessert.   The perfumer intended for Battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in Trabzon, a mountainous town on the Black Sea, and once an important gateway to Persia on the Spice Route. And it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario  the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. But for us, Battaniye is all about leather. A spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. It morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. Surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, Battaniye comes off as distinctly Western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. Battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding."," amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",battaniye meaning blanket turkish technically may term comfort scent well see amber patchouli draw conclusion leave scent enormous complexity great disservice although undeniably rich comfort battaniye leans far towards dry warmth textile wool leather silk dessert perfumer intend battaniye evoke feel watch rain balcony trabzon mountainous town black sea important gateway persia spice route certainly capture aromas scenario scent rain hit soil soot chimney oily warmth old wool blanket pull across one leg ward chill us battaniye leather spicy molten core leather roil heart fuel scent give resolutely masculine feel morphs slowly syrupy wetness almost animalic dusty warmth old leather surprisingly scent many oriental reference battaniye come distinctly western cowboys dusty leather saddle firmly heart thing battaniye comfort yes comfort memory atmosphere not pudding
eaumer eau de parfum,Pekji," Eaumer, a play on the perfumer's name (O-Mer), is the tonic we'd prescribe to anyone who's ever had a bad experience with an aquatic. Forget what you know about this genre, with its overdose of Calone and potent aromachemicals  Eaumer is here to turn the concept of aquatic on its head and reconfigure all your expectations. When you wear Eaumer, the most pleasant surprise is that a scent can be naturally rather than chemically marine-fresh. Salty anise, lime, and vetiver combine to evoke the brackish freshness of a sea breeze, mercifully free of the melony sweetness common to most aquatics. The lime note sluices everything with an antiseptic brightness that will jolt you awake. The natural gasoline and rubber facets of jasmine are brought forward and accentuated, cleverly creating a petrol-on-sea-water effect that feels novel but also refreshing. When all is said and done, though, ambergris is the rock on which Eaumer is built. Redolent of minty tobacco, minerals, and sea salt, the ambergris fills the scent with a radiant freshness, but also a lingering mammalian funk. And it's this contrast between bright and murky that makes Eaumer such a pleasure to wear on a hot day."," ambergris, anise, bergamot, Haitian vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk",eaumer play perfumer name omer tonic would prescribe anyone ever bad experience aquatic forget know genre overdose calone potent aromachemical eaumer turn concept aquatic head reconfigure expectation wear eaumer pleasant surprise scent naturally rather chemically marinefresh salty anise lime vetiver combine evoke brackish freshness sea breeze mercifully free melony sweetness common aquatics lime note sluice everything antiseptic brightness jolt awake natural gasoline rubber facet jasmine bring forward accentuate cleverly create petrolonseawater effect feel novel also refreshing say though ambergris rock eaumer build redolent minty tobacco mineral sea salt ambergris fills scent radiant freshness also linger mammalian funk contrast bright murky make eaumer pleasure wear hot day
b-612 extrait de parfum,Nishane," In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's beloved children's book Le Petit Prince, the titular Prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as B-612. Traveling the universe, the Prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on B-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" So it should come as no surprise that B-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. While the result feels sophisticated and masculine, B-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. The Little Prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- B-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go."," Lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",antoine de saintexuperys beloved children book le petit prince titular prince live come faraway asteroid know b612 travel universe prince carry spirit imagination openmindedness inquiry cultivate b612 thus fragrance name asteroid mean convey spirit put enlightenment exploration come no surprise b612 dynamic lively richly beautiful scent combine classically aromatic floral note geranium lavender deeply woody heart warm comfort base oakmoss tonka bean create something compellingly timeless result feel sophisticated masculine b612 never lose sight joyfully childlike inspiration scent wear adventure journeys new experience old friend little prince teach generation reader hold fast wonder goodwill far many lose approach adulthood b612 olfactive reminder one need never let go
vain & naive extrait de parfum,Nishane," ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""The character of the Rose in Le Petit Prince is an extremely important one- she is the Prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the Prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. With Vain & Naive, Nishane honors the Rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. Vain & Naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. Mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. The Little Prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his Flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. One sniff of Vain & Naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place."," Bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",time waste rise make rise important character rise le petit prince extremely important one prince true love beautiful yet flawed companion whose vanity naivete initially drive prince leave home asteroid ultimately realize flaw unique worthy love vain naive nishane honor rise wondrous complexity deliver airy lovely fruity floral rise scent unforgettable flair vain naive open arrestingly bright burst citrus quickly introduce floral heart rise jasmine combination youthfully fresh romantically lush mouthwatere note plum raspberry keep thing lively light gently ambere woody base glow soulful depth little prince ultimately opt return asteroid flower vanity naivete love undeniably real inherently worthwhile one sniff vain naive never want leave first place
hyouge eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," 6th century tea master Oribe Furuta fiercely adhered to the teaching of Sen Rikyu toalways be different from others and injected a fearless and liberated sense of beauty into the world of the tea ceremony.  His Hyouge (humor) pottery, called Oribe-yaki, with its characteristic dark green and black designs, appears modern, even by today's standards.As a fragrance designed to honor both the man himself and the exquisite art to which he dedicated his life, Hyouge is a fresh, floral green tea scent with uniquely Japanese nuance.From the gently powdered green freshness of the very first moments, it's clear that Hyouge is not just a tea scent, nor even just a green tea scent- it's a matcha scent, rich yet subtle, powdery yet bright, with an evocatively complex interplay of softly bitter and sweet notes. Iris and violet further the nuance, eschewing typical floral lushness for a smooth, powdered, gently woodsy base. As you might expect, Hyouge is a quiet scent, but like a true Sado ceremony, there's not a wasted movement- each detail is a touch of perfect, deliberate beauty. Matcha lovers- your new obsession has arrived.(Note: Trademark/name ofOribe has changed toHyouge)"," Green tea, sage, jasmine, violet, patchouli, woods, iris",6th century tea master oribe furuta fiercely adhere teaching sen rikyu toalway different inject fearless liberate sense beauty world tea ceremony hyouge humor pottery call oribeyaki characteristic dark green black design appear modern even today standard fragrance design honor man exquisite art dedicated life hyouge fresh floral green tea scent uniquely japanese nuance gently powder green freshness first moment clear hyouge not tea scent even green tea scent matcha scent rich yet subtle powdery yet bright evocatively complex interplay softly bitter sweet note iris violet nuance eschew typical floral lushness smooth powder gently woodsy base may expect hyouge quiet scent like true sado ceremony not waste movement detail touch perfect deliberate beauty matcha lover new obsession arrive note trademark name oforibe change tohyouge
komorebi eau de parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Komorebi: a Japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. It represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. Komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. In the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. There are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, Komorebi stands alone."," Mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",komorebi japanese term refer beauty natural sunlight filter forest canopy glow deciduous effect create represent connection land sky tree act perfect intermediary connect closely air earth conduit light energy life komorebi capture connection gorgeously delicate aromatic floral combine brace freshness wild mint rich gently sweet bouquet reseda mimosa blackcurrant note juicy aromatic softly powerful base hazelnut smooth lightly powder tonka bean support potent central note oak wood many foresttheme scent balance light dark earth air vegetation impossibly luminous tribute forest light bright komorebi stand alone
orange x santal eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," Orange X Santal, literally orange crossed with sandalwood  simple, handsome, and to the point. A radiant composition, the scent focuses on the meeting of a remarkable bitter orange note with the authentic creaminess of santalum album grown sustainably on Australian plantations, the same species of wood that gave us the original Mysore sandalwood. Orange X Santal keeps the structure uncluttered, allowing the raw materials to speak for themselves. The orange turns from juicy pulp to aromatic rind, before settling in a salty, metallic register that feels wonderfully bracing. The aromatic bitterness of the citrus is further underlined by a chorus of dark green notes, chief among them real oakmoss, a rugged cypress, and minty basil, all of which work to lend the scent a chypric tone. The creaminess of the sandalwood in the base is exquisite, but the scent holds fast to its basic character of salty woods, moss, and orange to the end, never ceding to sweetness. Leaning masculine? Yes, we think so. There is something about its brisk, mossy bitterness of Orange X Santal that suits a man, especially if he's wearing a conservative but light summer suit."," Bitter orange, Egyptian basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, Australian santalum album",orange x santal literally orange cross sandalwood simple handsome point radiant composition scent focus meeting remarkable bitter orange note authentic creaminess santalum album grow sustainably australian plantation specie wood give us original mysore sandalwood orange x santal keep structure uncluttered allow raw material speak orange turn juicy pulp aromatic rind settle salty metallic register feel wonderfully brace aromatic bitterness citrus underline chorus dark green note chief among real oakmoss rugged cypress minty basil work lend scent chypric tone creaminess sandalwood base exquisite scent hold fast basic character salty wood moss orange end never cede sweetness lean masculine yes think something brisk mossy bitterness orange x santal suit man especially wear conservative light summer suit
rose magnetic eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," Rose Magnetic is a great example of what Essential Parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. As addictive as its name suggests, Rose Magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a Pierre Hermes Ispahan macaron.   In the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. In the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher Turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. Swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of crÃ¨me patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. A pleasure from top to toe, Rose Magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple."," Grapefruit, peppermint, Turkish rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",rise magnetic great example essential parfum set zone great natural material hire great perfumer create simple elegant structure shine like perfectlypolishe stone addictive name suggest rise magnetic take us playful tour fresh sour fruity facet rise soften fluffy almond deliciousness pierre hermes ispahan macaron opening bitter grapefruit leafy mint play spicy herbaciousness rise give rise kind sourness make mouth water heart solventdistille rise give way lusher turkish rise absolute whose pert sweetness flesh addictively juicy litchi note swirls creamy musks vanilla natural tonka bean fluff cushion base expanse cra patisserie contrast berried tartness rise perfection pleasure top toe rise magnetic show us perfumer superb material confidence keep thing simple
mon vetiver eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," Mon Vetiver is a surprising and non-traditional vetiver, built on a series of contrasts between bright and dark, natural and synthetic, and modern and traditional, which serve to give this scent a truly distinctive character. Balancing its essentially serious character with the cheerful radiance of woody ambers, wearing Mon Vetiver feels like wearing a Savile Row suit with the lapels turned up. The structure of Mon Vetiver is very clever. It drapes a sparkling gin and tonic accord over a dark, woody fougÃ¨re-ish base for a play of light on dark that really grabs the attention. The rugged masculinity of vetiver is not hidden away or softened, but rather emphasized by the bitterness of lime and a fistful of pungent herbs - lavender and gentian. The play between natural and synthetic is perfectly pitched here too, the earthy sweetness of natural Indonesian patchouli illuminated and fluffed out by the sweet, musky glow of cashmeran. Woody, earthy, sweet, and expansive, this is a vetiver scent with both manners and swagger."," Haitian vetiver, gin accord, Mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, Indonesian patchouli",mon vetiver surprising nontraditional vetiver build series contrast bright dark natural synthetic modern traditional serve give scent truly distinctive character balance essentially serious character cheerful radiance woody amber wear mon vetiver feel like wear savile row suit lapels turn structure mon vetiver clever drapes sparkle gin tonic accord dark woody fouga reish base play light dark really grabs attention rugged masculinity vetiver not hide away soften rather emphasize bitterness lime fistful pungent herbs lavender gentian play natural synthetic perfectly pitch earthy sweetness natural indonesian patchouli illuminate fluffed sweet musky glow cashmeran woody earthy sweet expansive vetiver scent manners swagger
nice bergamote eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," Nice Bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! In fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. The juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural Calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. What's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by Mother Nature herself.  For example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. A buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. It's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. The base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from Venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. The tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. If you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then Nice Bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect."," bergamot, Jasmine Grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang ylang, tonka bean",nice bergamote indeed nice bergamot fact think name may undersell tad juicy sourness fine 100 natural calabrian bergamot extract burst bottle like firework drench sense icy freshness feel like liquid sunshine remarkable support note match bergamot naturalness fade picture depend volatility design mother nature example soft eddy natural jasmine rise petal swirls heart create velvety thickness step tartness topnote begin fade buttery ylang lick edges add fleshy sensuality bright note none flower usual loudness worth note bergamot never disappear completely soften verdant limey sourness thread mandarinlike juiciness run scent connect part base play host natural tonka bean extract venezuela smell like golden cream hay almond espresso shoot milk tonka bean accent subtle not overly sweet rein smoky resinous cedarwood look naturalsmelle bergamot scent not devolve usual white musks woody amber nice bergamot nice perfect
the musc eau de parfum,Essential Parfums," Every line needs a musk, and this is The Musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. Calice Becker said she imagined this scentas a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk, and that's a great way to describe its effect. Wearing The Musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love.   The Musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold  it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. Applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. But copious amounts of Laotian beeswax and Australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. These notes  both fresh and warm  are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. Nirvanolide and Serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by Givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur."," Ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musks",every line need musk musc name signpost brand sense humor specialness scent calice becker say imagine scentas cloud envelop comfort musk great way describe effect wear musc like step freezing cold home fill warmth love musk operate narrow margin hot cold fresh spicy enough keep awake time creamily warm feel like cat stretch languorously front open fire apply warm skin initial onetwo punch freshlycrushed lavender red ginger feel spicy herbal copious amount laotian beeswax australian santalum album soak aromatics sweet honey creaminess warm lamb wool throw note fresh warm finally sweep cloud whip musks wrap wearer velvety cloud scent nirvanolide serenolide elegantly fruity musks produce givaudan true name create serene nirvanaesque fluffiness clean kitten fur

dent de lait eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," We often look back on milestone events from our childhood with great poignancy, recalling the feeling of innocence and wonder, and the moment that feeling begins to change. Dent de Lait is just that, a poignant celebration one of our earliest rights of passage during that most magical period of our lives. The loss of one's baby teeth serves as a metaphor for and a harbinger of the inevitable march toward adolescence, and this fragrance captures it with great aplomb. A flash of metallic zing opens bracingly, conjuring the slightly metallic flavor of the void where a baby tooth once roosted. The quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way to a creamy-soft and reassuring smoothness through the deft use of almond milk, coconut and floral aldehydes, transporting you to that moment just before you began to trade your innocence for wisdom.Creamy, smooth and ultimately reassuring, this gourmand is imbued with a sense of cloistered security, connecting us to that comforting feeling we enjoyed when we were young."," Almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note.",often look back milestone event childhood great poignancy recall feel innocence wonder moment feel begin change dent de lait poignant celebration one early right passage magical period life loss one baby teeth serve metaphor harbinger inevitable march toward adolescence fragrance capture great aplomb flash metallic zing open bracingly conjure slightly metallic flavor void baby tooth roosted quick yet subtle bitterness slowly give way creamysoft reassure smoothness deft use almond milk coconut floral aldehyde transport moment begin trade innocence wisdom creamy smooth ultimately reassure gourmand imbue sense cloistered security connect us comfort feel enjoyed young
fougere d'argent eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," FougÃ¨re d'Argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougÃ¨re, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. With oakmoss no longer available, Tom Ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with Akigalawood, a Givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. What emerges from Ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine  earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. If there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably FougÃ¨re d'Argent. The aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal Savile Row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. Akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. What marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. Whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. Fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from Gris Clair to Tom Ford's own Fucking Fabulous will likely love FougÃ¨re d'Argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. Dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, FougÃ¨re d'Argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing."," mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, Akigalawood, coumarin Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Fougere d'Argent by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

live in colors eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," The perfect citrus is an elusive thing. Pretty much the Holy Grail of perfumery, in fact. Citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. We're happy to report that Live in Colors pulls it off. It sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. In other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat.  The fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. It smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. The scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. There's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. In the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. Live in Colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. It's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. But a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us  it just needs to smell fresh and natural. And in that respect, Live in Colors scores a perfect 10."," Lemon, grapefruit, citrus, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",perfect citrus elusive thing pretty much holy grail perfumery fact citrus note volatile perfumer figure keep aloft keep scent smell natural way balance act far hard may imagine happy report live color pull sparkle top bottom without lose momentum along way word new summer freshie beat fizz opening invigorate burst lemon grapefruit sharp taste smell like entire citrus tree pulp squeeze bottle everything leaf pulp rind scent deftly switch charge aromatics run juice bed pink pepper ginger root keep volatile citrus note alive wonderful hotcold effect go background juicy sweetness red fruit rub coldness spice base soft silvery hinoki wood support aromatic note not impose personality insistently cedar gaiac live color not much end fade gently muskywoody trail stay soft clean not projection monster not break longevity record citrus scent not need perform acrobatic please us need smell fresh natural respect live color score perfect 10
just before eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Just Before revolves around Palo Santo, the so-calledHoly Wood burned by the Incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. The wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. It smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of Palo Santo incense  smoky, but with a lively sparkle.  A rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. The contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the Hypnotic Poison model. But what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. Redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmandpatisserie elements. Delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, Just Before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. But because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. Sugar and spice and all things nice....Just Before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",revolve around palo santo socalledholy wood burn incas shamans cleanse spirit wood sweetly fragrant note pine lemon mint feature perfumer cleverly choose accentuate equally bright trio bergamot lemon saffron melt effortlessly wood leave film orangey spice glitter pale blond surface smell like citrus peel cinnamon left smolder top freshlylit piece palo santo incense smoky lively sparkle rich bananaish ylang dollop butter stir cake thickening fragrance ease wood citruses spice doughiness benzoin contrast minty aromatics vanillasodden resin give scent interesting bitter almond nuance not far hypnotic poison model really stand us myrrh redolent earth wet stone anise ancient resin add enormous depth well sepulchral darkness contrast scent gourmandpatisserie element delicious almost edible spicy warmth teeter precariously incense amber wood never tip one category remain interesting sugar spice thing nicejust seductive siren call call us like proverbial gingerbread cottage forest

hyrax extrait de parfum,Zoologist," Climbing to its perch in the morning sky, the African sun reaches across a mountain range to caress a wide, flat boulder, baking it to a gentle heat. From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.At the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery  African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature.

amber intense eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," The oriental, reinvented. When Fragrance du Bois set their sights on amber as a main component for their newest Prive release, our expectations- and imaginations- were sky high.

moth extrait de parfum,Zoologist," Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes. At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and dark, inky florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame."," Black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver",day spend seclude camouflage intricate pattern wing disguising coarse backdrop bark rock finally stir even flight conceal shroud beneath cover night moonlight ripples delicate coat tiny hair feather antennae guide search mate one temptation lure quest succumb attraction flame urge procreate may quash wisp smoke smatter ashe first encounter rich gothic scent zoologist moth may surprise soon hypnotizes heavy dose dark spice jolt sense settle dusting honeysweet rise dark inky floral slowly test wing take flight exotic journey nagarmotha guaiac wood patchouli beneath linger smoky undertone serve constant reminder danger within tantalizing flame
unsettled eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Since when does the end of the world smell so pleasant? It's a fair question if your first exposure to Unsettled was the hand-blown flacon originally commissioned by the Nevada Museum of Art: an atomic blast shaped container that literally glowed green from the uranium glass used to craft it. So it's something of a surprise that the scent itself is downright happy- a fresh, creamy sandalwood brightened even more with mouthwatering pineapple and smooth black tea. The result is a wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent that feels like a day on the beach- smooth, easy to wear, and almost hypnotically relaxing. It's the kind of fragrance that would make an effortless signature- it's hard to imagine a circumstance or person it wouldn't smell amazing on. It's Bruno's clever way of juxtaposing the occasionally- but consequentially- overlapping histories of Nevada and the South Pacific. No, your bottle won't be made of uranium glass- we're pretty sure that wouldn't be a big hit with our shippers- but one spritz and you won't be worried about a thing."," Bergamot, china black tea, clary sage, pineapple, caledonian sandalwood, labdanum, vanilla, ocean breezes",since end world smell pleasant fair question first exposure unsettle handblown flacon originally commission nevada museum art atomic blast shape container literally glow green uranium glass use craft something surprise scent downright happy fresh creamy sandalwood brighten even mouthwatere pineapple smooth black tea result wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent feel like day beach smooth easy wear almost hypnotically relax kind fragrance would make effortless signature hard imagine circumstance person would not smell amazing bruno clever way juxtapose occasionally consequentially overlap history nevada south pacific no bottle not make uranium glass pretty sure would not big hit shippers one spritz not worried thing

hallucinogenic pearl eau de parfum,A Lab on Fire," While no serious fragrance enthusiast would ever question the luxuriousness of orris butter- the rich, earthy-creamy depth, the papyrus-like smoothness- it's fair to ask a simpler question: is it any fun?

Perhaps that's why we love Hallucinogenic Pearl so much- preternaturally light-on-its-feet, it's an orris-based stunner that deploys fresh musks and smooth leather to conjure up a higher, happier plane of existence where orris is not only sophisticated, but sparkling.

fior fiore eau de parfum,Eau d'Italie," The iconic image of the Hotel Le Sirenuse, the inspiration behind Eau d'Italie, is from the outside- who could forget the gorgeous cliffs and sparkling blue water of the Amalfi Coast? But the man-made elements of the hotel are every bit as magical- case in point, the grand, dreamlike Champagne Bar, which winds from beautifully contoured interior out onto an enchanting terrace replete with charming mosaic work and a variety of night-blooming jasmine plants, who release their intoxicating scent into the warm evening air, creamy, fresh and seductive. This is the inspiration behind Fior Fiore, summer nights on the terrace, surrounded by flowers, the day's sun a faint glow beyond the horizon. Lush lily of the valley intertwines with a gentle but deeply romantic jasmine, all supported with a fresh, comforting ambrette musk.

terra mia eau de parfum,Carthusia," Carthusia has long held a well-earned reputation for their ability to capture the olfactory beauty of the Italian landscape- azure sea, juicy citrus, wild aromatic vegetation, and shining sun. But Terra Mia, a rare Carthusia gourmand, seems more inspired by the simple joys of traditional Italian life and culture- gatherings in the village square, puppet shows, fresh flowers in the market, and steaming cups of espresso. So while it opens with wonderful freshness- tart bergamot, bright pink pepper- the grand players here are warmer, deeper notes- mouthwatering hazelnut, sweet orange blossom, lush rose, and robust coffee, all set against a resinously ambered wood base both rich and soothing. As with all Carthusia scents, we feel transported, but this time we're in an ancient piazza full of life and laughter, an espresso in hand, joy in our hearts. We might not have grown up in Italy, but one sniff of Terra Mia and you'll agree- it feels like home."," Bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods",carthusia long hold wellearne reputation ability capture olfactory beauty italian landscape azure sea juicy citrus wild aromatic vegetation shine sun terra mia rare carthusia gourmand seem inspire simple joys traditional italian life culture gathering village square puppet show fresh flower market steam cup espresso open wonderful freshness tart bergamot bright pink pepper grand player warm deeply note mouthwatere hazelnut sweet orange blossom lush rise robust coffee set resinously ambere wood base rich soothe carthusia scent feel transport time ancient piazza full life laughter espresso hand joy heart may not grow italy one sniff terra mia agree feel like home
erawan eau de parfum,Dusita," Erawan is the scent of late summer tipping into fall. It is the smell of the harvest, with fields of aromatic barley, hay, and oats waiting to be brought in, the earthy goodness of nuts, flour, and honey stacked high in the larder, and the wholesome, leaf-brownness of tobacco leaves drying on barn floors. It is not an uncommon theme in indie perfumery, but Erawan stands proud of other examples by way of two things. First, Dusita's sophisticated style of making perfumes puts a high-definition gloss on the rustic theme, making it the perfect choice for a young Paris or New York sophisticate who wants real, but who also wants polished. Second, whereas most fragrances with a countryside bent are loaded with syrupy sweetness, booze, or fruit, Erawan boasts only the gentle sweetness of nuts, hay, and herbs, thus making it an airy, elegant wear. A series of little contrasts has been cleverly worked into the composition to give the scent texture and movement. There is the herbal brightness of clary sage and petigrain up top, but also a nutty, creamy undercurrent of vetiver to provide depth. Liatris, or deertongue, a plant extract that lends perfumes a coumarin-like tone, gives off the scent of freshly-toasted tobacco leaf, but its dry resinousness is nicely offset by the damp, fresh greenery of a surprising muguet note planted in the center. The inky bitterness of oakmoss is suggestive of long shadows under oak trees, but a judicious dose of vanilla softens everything into a delicious, late-afternoon blur. Erawan wears like a ray of sunshine on your face. Both beautiful and unusual, its rustic charm does not come at the cost of sophistication."," herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, Haitian vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla",erawan scent late summer tip fall smell harvest field aromatic barley hay oats wait bring earthy goodness nuts flour honey stack high larder wholesome leafbrownness tobacco leave drying barn floor not uncommon theme indie perfumery erawan stand proud example way two thing first dusitas sophisticated style make perfumes put highdefinition gloss rustic theme make perfect choice young paris new york sophisticate want real also want polished second whereas fragrance countryside bent loaded syrupy sweetness booze fruit erawan boast gentle sweetness nuts hay herbs thus make airy elegant wear series little contrast cleverly work composition give scent texture movement herbal brightness clary sage petigrain top also nutty creamy undercurrent vetiver provide depth liatris deertongue plant extract lend perfumes coumarinlike tone give scent freshlytoaste tobacco leaf dry resinousness nicely offset damp fresh greenery surprising muguet note plant center inky bitterness oakmoss suggestive long shadow oak tree judicious dose vanilla softens everything delicious lateafternoon blur erawan wear like ray sunshine face beautiful unusual rustic charm not come cost sophistication
fleur de lalita eau de parfum,Dusita," Fleur de Lalita is a bouquet of tropical flowers that has grown up, moved to France, and taken up smoking and reading Baudelaire. Peel back the layers and you'll see that its core of lush ylang ylang, tropical lilies, and magnolia remains intact. But bookended by a smoky galbanum up top and salty, lived-in ambergris down below, Fleur de Lalita is definitely a floral for adults. The playoff between milky sweetness of tropical flowers and the smoky, salty galbanum-ambergris tandem is what makes Fleur de Lalita such a tour de force. The innocent side of Fleur de Lalita shows its face first, with a cluster of jasmine, magnolia, and lily so wet and crisp it might have been cut from the garden just moments before. Curlicues of buttery ylang ylang snake around the white petals as you bury your face in this bouquet, releasing a steamy tropical undercurrent. But the damp lushness of the flowers is almost immediately cut by a waft of galbanum, a green resin whose smell is pitched halfway between freshly-cut plant stems and smoke. The effect is of being in a tropical garden while someone is smoking an illicit cigarette in a nearby ylang bush, the smoke mingling gently with the creamy flowers. A dash of resinous sandalwood gives the florals and greenery a handsome backbone. But the real payoff comes in the base, when musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris to form a sweet and salty skin-like nuance that will send you over the top. The combination of creamy florals, crisp greenery, smoke, and salty musks in Fleur de Lalita is simply stunning. This is the fragrance that will make you feel like the best version of yourself, every day of your life."," Rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",fleur de lalita bouquet tropical flower grow move france take smoking read baudelaire peel back layer see core lush ylang ylang tropical lily magnolia remain intact bookende smoky galbanum top salty livedin ambergris fleur de lalita definitely floral adult playoff milky sweetness tropical flower smoky salty galbanumambergris tandem make fleur de lalita tour de force innocent side fleur de lalita show face first cluster jasmine magnolia lily wet crisp may cut garden moment curlicue buttery ylang ylang snake around white petal bury face bouquet release steamy tropical undercurrent damp lushness flower almost immediately cut waft galbanum green resin whose smell pitch halfway freshlycut plant stem smoke effect tropical garden someone smoking illicit cigarette nearby ylang bush smoke mingle gently creamy flower dash resinous sandalwood give floral greenery handsome backbone real payoff come base musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris form sweet salty skinlike nuance send top combination creamy floral crisp greenery smoke salty musks fleur de lalita simply stunning fragrance make feel like good version every day life

fantastic oud eau de parfum,Montale," What is the true identity of oud? While the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence.

orris tattoo eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Orris Tattoo pays tribute to one of perfumery's most incredible raw materials  orris root. While florists adore the delicate, arching flowers and tall green stems of the iris, perfumers are far more interested in the unprepossessing-looking root underneath. The process of making orris butter is a real labor of love. The iris roots, or rhizomes as they are known, are left to grow underground for three years, and then left to dry out in a cool storeroom for another three years. The result is the most expensive butter you will never find on any supermarket shelf  a silvery substance that Chandler Burr once referred to asliquid good taste. Like pure orris butter itself, Orris Tattoo smells like the ground and the sky all bound together in one smell. To wit, it smells like bread, violets, eau de vie, suede shoes, cold air, and silky earth. Rooty and somewhat fresh at fresh, the scent soon develops a putty-like texture that remains cool to the touch, like chilled butter taken from a florist's fridge. The orris here feels very pure, but it won't make you feel like you're chomping on raw carrots  its purity is gentle, wrapped in a cashmere blanket. This purity is sustained right through to the supple grey suede that develops in the lower registers of the scent. With a material as exquisite as orris root, we pleased to see that Orris Tattoo resists the temptation to add on too many bells and whistles  apart from a touch of what feels like humid, coconutty sandalwood, cashmere woods, and a hint of violets or heliotrope, this fragrance never really deviates from the orris root hymn sheet. So, if you're looking for the doughy but ethereal pleasures of pure orris, then put Orris Tattoo on your test list stat.", Orris root,orris tattoo pays tribute one perfumerys incredible raw material orris root florist adore delicate arch flower tall green stem iris perfumer far interested unprepossessinglooking root underneath process make orris butter real labor love iris root rhizomes know left grow underground three year left dry cool storeroom another three year result expensive butter never find supermarket shelf silvery substance chandler burr refer asliquid good taste like pure orris butter orris tattoo smell like ground sky bound together one smell wit smell like bread violet eau de vie suede shoe cold air silky earth rooty somewhat fresh fresh scent soon develop puttylike texture remain cool touch like chill butter take florist fridge orris feel pure not make feel like chomp raw carrot purity gentle wrap cashmere blanket purity sustained right supple grey suede develop low register scent material exquisite orris root pleased see orris tattoo resist temptation add many bell whistle apart touch feel like humid coconutty sandalwood cashmere wood hint violet heliotrope fragrance never really deviate orris root hymn sheet look doughy ethereal pleasure pure orris put orris tattoo test list stat
chypre mojo eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 1917, there was a new shape in the air when Coty launched its now legendary Chypre de Coty. Putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. In the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like Mitsouko, Tabac Blond, and Pour Monsieur. Of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). In this post-IFRA age, and 100 years on from the launch of Chypre de Coty, Parle-Moi de Parfum suggests that Chypre Mojo is what a chypre now looks like. Despite the absence of oakmoss, Chypre Mojo rolls in with all the presence of a properold skool perfume. Its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. A bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. Chypre Mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. While the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. Confident, modern, and ebullient, Chypre Mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo."," Bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",1917 new shape air coty launch legendary chypre de coty put forth idea perfume could smell indefinably complex person wear landmark scent sweep away cobwebs simple floral perfumery previous century century follow chypre idea prove endure one seemingly endless permutation bergamot labdanum oakmoss give rise meaningful perfumes world like mitsouko tabac blond pour monsieur course time stop no man no chypre postifra age 100 year launch chypre de coty parlemoi de parfum suggest chypre mojo chypre look like despite absence oakmoss chypre mojo roll presence properold skool perfume combination carnation patchouli conjure phantasmagoric impression massive rosepatch chypre soak plum wine dust black pepper bright pulpy heart mango take stiff bone chypre age backwards feel legible young audience chypre mojo never feel less chypre though fruit keep feelgood endorphin flow peppery carnation patchouli duo add touch vermouth dryness say chypre clear bell confident modern ebullient chypre mojo make us think 100 year chypre still mojo
heritage eau de parfum,Fragrance du Bois," Many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but Heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when European high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. Truly a haute couture scent, Heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. Heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. A complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. Taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. Sure, we'll never get to live in Paris as it was in the Belle Epoque, but with Heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be."," Bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure organic vintage oud",many fragrance offer journey faraway destination heritage journey back time era european high society bold beautiful sumptuously opulent fragrance every bit standard truly haute couture scent heritage elegant alluring potion evoke grand ballrooms ornate theater true taste kind luxury often sadly confine bygone age heritage open vintage panache feature fresh invigorate note juicy bergamot bright twinkle sparkle ethereal aldehyde complex yet approachable heart sweet jasmine powdery orris elevated touch mystical frankincense rich dignified base warm blend wood creamy vanilla superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth take whole kind opulence prefer pamper rather overwhelm genuinely comfort confer almost hypnotic sense wellbeing wearer sure never get live paris belle epoque heritage visit glamorous visit
vanille benjoin eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," Upon application, Vanille Benjoin immediately envelops its wearer in a soft, protective cocoon of vanilla that we find insanely comforting. It's a hug in a bottle. The perfumer, an island native herself, helped the brand to source two types of very special vanilla for this scent  the first, a soft, floral Tahitian vanilla, and the second, a resinous Madagascaran vanilla. The vanillas add a toasty warmth to the scent, as well as a deliciousroundness, but it's worth noting that there's nothing sugary or heavy about Vanille Benjoin. The vanilla here is dry and woody, tending towards the savory end of the spectrum rather than the sweet.The salty diffusiveness of ambroxan certainly helps to control sweetness, but the main hand in ensuring the scent remains dry is the Siam benzoin, the basenote material chosen here to bemarried to the vanilla. Although benzoin is roughly analogous to vanilla in that they both add a warm, sweetfullness to the basenotes of a scent, benzoin differs substantially by being far more medicinal, resinous, and spicy-peppery in character. In Vanille Benjoin, the fiery cinnamon topnotes of benzoin are cleverly matched, step for step, by cedarwood, a material possessed of a similarly spicy, balsamic underbite. In an equally smart move, the doughy, clay-like properties of benzoin are drawn out by a judicious application of tonka bean absolute, which shares with benzoin a buttery texture and nutty aftertaste. Vanille Benjoin resolves itself in a delicious vanilla suede accord that signals pure luxury and comfort, without any of attendant stodge - powdered sugar diffused in the crisp, cold air of a winter's morning."," Tahitian vanilla absolute, Madagascan vanilla absolute, Siamese benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar",upon application vanille benjoin immediately envelop wearer soft protective cocoon vanilla find insanely comfort hug bottle perfumer island native help brand source two type special vanilla scent first soft floral tahitian vanilla second resinous madagascaran vanilla vanilla add toasty warmth scent well deliciousroundness worth note nothing sugary heavy vanille benjoin vanilla dry woody tend towards savory end spectrum rather sweet salty diffusiveness ambroxan certainly help control sweetness main hand ensure scent remain dry siam benzoin basenote material choose bemarrie vanilla although benzoin roughly analogous vanilla add warm sweetfullness basenote scent benzoin differ substantially far medicinal resinous spicypeppery character vanille benjoin fiery cinnamon topnote benzoin cleverly match step step cedarwood material possess similarly spicy balsamic underbite equally smart move doughy claylike property benzoin drawn judicious application tonka bean absolute share benzoin buttery texture nutty aftertaste vanille benjoin resolve delicious vanilla suede accord signal pure luxury comfort without attendant stodge powder sugar diffuse crisp cold air winter morning
santal basmati eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," The deeply fragrant aroma of Basmati rice is one of the best smells in the world, and frankly, we're a little surprised it doesn't turn up in more perfumes. In Santal Basmati, perfumer Alexandra Carlin, taking her cue from founder Sophie Broneau's passion for basenotes, cleverly pairs the scent of cooked rice to the most precious and fragrant of woods: Mysore sandalwood (s. album), grown sustainably in Kerala. Why clever? Well, you'll notice that basmati rice has a lot in common with sandalwood  they share a certain creaminess, as well as a steamy, nutty undertone akin to grains toasted in butter and cooked long and slow in milk. Santal Basmati simply identifies the facets they have in common, unites them, and serves us up a bowl of pure bliss. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, given all these milky, woody notes, Santal Basmati is a rather heavy concoction  but it's really not. A remarkable sleight of hand injects the composition with an airiness that ensures that, while certainly comforting and warming, the scent wears as lightly as a silk cardigan. The sweetness level is nicely judged too, with a buttered popcorn nuance adding a hint of salt, and a supporting framework of woods that stops the scent tipping over completely into rice pudding territory. If you love the triple crÃ¨me comfort factor of woody gourmands such as Santal Majuscule (Serge Lutens), Palo Santo (Carner Barcelona), or PralinÃ© de Santal (Pierre Guillaume), then let us tell you straight: you need some Santal Basmati in your life."," Mysore sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran",deeply fragrant aroma basmati rice one good smell world frankly little surprised not turn perfumes santal basmati perfumer alexandra carlin take cue founder sophie broneaus passion basenote cleverly pairs scent cook rice precious fragrant wood mysore sandalwood album grow sustainably kerala clever well notice basmati rice lot common sandalwood share certain creaminess well steamy nutty undertone akin grain toast butter cook long slow milk santal basmati simply identifies facet common unite serve us bowl pure bliss would forgive think give milky woody note santal basmati rather heavy concoction really not remarkable sleight hand inject composition airiness ensure certainly comfort warm scent wear lightly silk cardigan sweetness level nicely judge butter popcorn nuance add hint salt support framework wood stop scent tip completely rice pudding territory love triple cra comfort factor woody gourmand santal majuscule serge lutens palo santo carner barcelona pralina de santal pierre guillaume let us tell straight need santal basmati life
cedre iris eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," Cedre Iris is that rare bird  a 100% equal partnership between delicate iris pallida and a material that would normally eat it for breakfast, namely a tough, resinous cedarwood. Well, three types of cedarwood, to be exact, the combination of which gives the composition a complex woody profile that darts between smoky, leathery, balsamic, and spicy. But in Cedre Iris, the tension between the heavy cedarwood and the ephemeral orris is held tight, allowing the cool, waxen orris to float serenely over the very material that would normally subsume it. The payoff of this impressive balancing act is a fragrance that highlights both the exquisitely powdery sheen of iris and the spicy thickness of cedar. Iris pallida from Florence, which costs $60,000 per kilo, has been used in significant quantities here, so you really feel its presence. But Iris Cedre is not a monolith. The iris and cedarwood star, for sure, but in time, you will notice that they are supported by elements that cast their own shadows. Particularly noticeable is the cinnamon-dusted benzoin that sands down the cedar and orris into a soft blur of incensey, vanillic powder, for dramatic scent trail that's sure to turn heads. But myrrh also plays a significant role here, lending the drydown in particular a crepuscular, almost fungal earthiness that serves to highlight the pale dustiness of the iris. Wax, butter, silver, earth, incense, and polished woods  Iris Cedre truly is the last word in tailored elegance."," Cedar (Moroccan Atlas, Texas, Virginia), Florentine iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",cedre iris rare bird 100 equal partnership delicate iris pallida material would normally eat breakfast namely tough resinous cedarwood well three type cedarwood exact combination give composition complex woody profile dart smoky leathery balsamic spicy cedre iris tension heavy cedarwood ephemeral orris hold tight allow cool waxen orris float serenely material would normally subsume payoff impressive balance act fragrance highlight exquisitely powdery sheen iris spicy thickness cedar iris pallida florence cost 60000 per kilo use significant quantity really feel presence iris cedre not monolith iris cedarwood star sure time notice support element cast shadow particularly noticeable cinnamonduste benzoin sand cedar orris soft blur incensey vanillic powder dramatic scent trail sure turn head myrrh also play significant role lending drydown particular crepuscular almost fungal earthiness serve highlight pale dustiness iris wax butter silver earth incense polished wood iris cedre truly last word tailor elegance
patchouli oud eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," Tom Waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car""  and Patchouli Oud by perfumer Nicolas Bonneville has much the same quality. Earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of Indonesian and Javan jungles, Patchouli Oud is a study in brown. Many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but Patchouli Oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. The oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. As with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. The smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms Patchouli Oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit."," Oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",tom wait voice memorably describe music critic sound soak vat bourbon left hang smokehouse month take outside run car patchouli oud perfumer nicolas bonneville much quality earthy tannic soak mysterious essence wrench tree depth indonesian javan jungles patchouli oud study brown many oudbase fragrance smell pungent oily patchouli oud plumps dry almost herbal take subject matter result run surprisingly close clip elegance vintage powerhouse masculine oud medicinal slightly dirty first gate quickly follow dusty 100 cocoa patchouli seem invert light draw us deeply shadow scent base entirely heavy basenote always danger turn lead balloon avoid thanks use bright grassy vetiver lemony smoke elemi resin keep composition aerate smoky chypric finish whiskeyish labdanum bitter oakmoss confirm patchouli oud perfect choice gentleman dare enough pull oud scent alongside perfectly tailor threepiece suit
musc ambre gris eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," Ambergris, the precious sperm whale excretion that's aged for years by the ocean, is the purest essence of the sea. It's an unusual material in perfumery because although it derives from an animal and retains a distinctly animalic character, it also smells mineral, earthy, ozonic, and foresty. In fact, one could say that the scent of ambergris is a microcosm of nature's bounty in full. Ambergris is something of a shapeshifter in perfumery, though  it's suggestible. In Musc Ambre Gris, the perfumer has nudged the natural ambergris towards a saltier, woodsier interpretation than some of the sweeter, more amber-focused compositions in the genre. What's striking about this fragrance is that it smells completely organic, as if it were ripped from nature and not made in a lab. It encompasses all the wind-chafed aromas of a desolate beach in winter, ranging from desiccated driftwood, crushed seashells, and minerals to the inky bitterness of marine lichen. Musc Ambre Gris smells vivid and wild, its smoky tangle of sea grasses (vetiver), yerba mate, and sharp black musk with its creosote-like tang all pulling together to emphasize the raspy, masculine-leaning character of the scent. In the far drydown, earthy patchouli and white truffle add a fungal depth that accentuates the salt-flat brininess of the ambergris. A perfume of scorched earth, Musc Ambre Gris has the brooding intensity of a young Brando- not to mention the undeniable seductiveness."," Amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver",ambergris precious sperm whale excretion aged year ocean pure essence sea unusual material perfumery although derive animal retain distinctly animalic character also smell mineral earthy ozonic foresty fact one could say scent ambergris microcosm nature bounty full ambergris something shapeshifter perfumery though suggestible musc ambre gris perfumer nudge natural ambergris towards saltier woodsier interpretation sweeter amberfocuse composition genre strike fragrance smell completely organic rip nature not make lab encompasse windchafe aromas desolate beach winter range desiccated driftwood crush seashells mineral inky bitterness marine lichen musc ambre gris smell vivid wild smoky tangle sea grass vetiver yerba mate sharp black musk creosotelike tang pull together emphasize raspy masculineleane character scent far drydown earthy patchouli white truffle add fungal depth accentuate saltflat brininess ambergris perfume scorched earth musc ambre gris brood intensity young brando not mention undeniable seductiveness
cuir curcuma eau de parfum,Affinessence Paris," The first fragrance in the world to use natural extract of turmeric, Cuir Curcuma is a strikingly different kind of leather fragrance. Neither a Russian nor a Spanish (Moorish) leather, but rather, an Indian leather, it rises like a phoenix from the clay attar stills and tanning yards of Kannauj, where ancient ayurvedic principles of balance in all things still reigns supreme. Cuir Curcuma is fine leather cured with lots of earthy golden spice and hot milk, for a result that's unusual enough to be distinctive but delicious enough to be comforting.  Cuir Curcuma cleverly plays on the theme of a traditional Indian drink called Golden Milk, an ayurvedic tonic taken in India to cleanse the bloodstream and balance all doshas. This golden elixir balances the iodic bitterness of turmeric with the sweet creaminess of whole milk, pulverized almonds, sugar, and pistachios. You'll find that the same push-pull betweeneat me anddon't eat me carried through to the fragrance itself. The crazy-delicious lactones thrown off by the sandalwood create asteamed milk effect similar to the one in Santal Basmati, but here it is spicier - woods cooked down with resin until the bottom layer catches and caramelizes. It smells incredibly tasty, but also tasteful, a sprinkle of salty, anisic myrrh stopping the scent from straying too far into gourmandise. Cuir Curcuma is a scent full of drama, its inky medicinal notes making you sit up and take notice. Sweepingly exotic, yet seductively cozy, this is the leather jacket you never thought you could pull off, and now can't live without."," Turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",first fragrance world use natural extract turmeric cuir curcuma strikingly different kind leather fragrance neither russian spanish moorish leather rather indian leather rise like phoenix clay attar still tan yards kannauj ancient ayurvedic principle balance thing still reigns supreme cuir curcuma fine leather cure lot earthy golden spice hot milk result unusual enough distinctive delicious enough comfort cuir curcuma cleverly play theme traditional indian drink call golden milk ayurvedic tonic take india cleanse bloodstream balance doshas golden elixir balance iodic bitterness turmeric sweet creaminess whole milk pulverize almond sugar pistachio find pushpull betweeneat anddo not eat carry fragrance crazydelicious lactone throw sandalwood create asteame milk effect similar one santal basmati spicy wood cook resin bottom layer catches caramelize smell incredibly tasty also tasteful sprinkle salty anisic myrrh stop scent stray far gourmandise cuir curcuma scent full drama inky medicinal note make sit take notice sweepingly exotic yet seductively cozy leather jacket never think could pull not live without

tempo eau de parfum,Diptyque," All too often,  patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""It's patchouli, "" the refrain goes,  ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" Tempo,  the wonderful new patchouli scent from Diptyque,  defies such simple-minded rejection- after all,  it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by Tempo's complex,  gorgeous subtlety,  which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet,  delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven,  yet undeniably sophisticated.By building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced,  ethically-harvested varieties of Indonesian patchouli,  Olivier Pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy,  woodsy,  spicy and sweet,  all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. This careful balance is further enhanced with lively,  green violet leaf and nutty,  spicy mate,  which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. Even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans,  give Tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again."," Bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",often patchouli scent seem apologize star ingredient patchouli refrain go not hippie patchouli tempo wonderful new patchouli scent diptyque defie simpleminde rejection explicitly inspire 60 counterculture fear unbearably thick earthiness lack nuance surely delighted tempos complex gorgeous subtlety wed three distinct type patchouli perfectly balance mix mate violet deliver scent unapologetically patchoulidriven yet undeniably sophisticated build around carefully calibrate mix three sustainablysource ethicallyharveste variety indonesian patchouli olivi pescheux deliver patchouli accord celebrate facet material earthy woodsy spicy sweet balance one another subtle elegance careful balance enhance lively green violet leaf nutty spicy mate serve remove even tiny edges scent patchouli wash gently hard even remember would ever consider divisive ingredient even long ago trade bell bottom designer jeans give tempo chance may never think patchouli way
fleur de peau eau de parfum,Diptyque," As part of Diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, Fleur de Peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. Warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? By wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, Fleur de Peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.The musks at the core of Fleur de Peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. A beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. All together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. It's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for Diptyque's 50th anniversary? Musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived."," Aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",part diptyque 50th anniversary celebration fleur de peau mean turn back clock 1960s one counterculture beloved scent musk warm sweet deeply sensual musk oil 60 powerful subtle update classic feel today grownup yet nostalgic audience wedding gorgeous bouquet various musks beautiful irisdriven floral heart fleur de peau us awe sophisticated subtle musky perfection musks core fleur de peau simply put heavenly divine combination note cottonsoft rich light soapygiven extra element sparkle perfect amount aldehyde beautiful iris note bit powder bit paper touch woodsy earth primarily clean blend fruity gently ambery ambrette seed ambergris extend rich mineralic tone deepen musks without displacing together create skin scent every bit much complexity tower oriental kind fragrance bring back wrist countless time scent impressive lifespan trip forwards backwards time scent celebrate past sophistication future really could perfect diptyque 50th anniversary musk lover perfect skin scent arrive
lost in flowers eau de parfum,Strangelove NYC," If you've ever tried out a bunch of floral perfumes and said to yourself, nope, just not floral enough, then let us introduce you to Lost in Flowers. Remember the scene from American Beauty when the cheerleader lying in the bath was showered with rose petals? Well, replace the roses with champaca, muguet, and gardenia petals, and that's what wearing Lost in Flowers feels like. Most aptly named, Lost in Flowers is a sublime experience akin to submerging oneself in a warm bath of heady, fragrant, life-giving flowers.   Called joy oil in India, the rare red champaca otto used in Lost in Flowers casts a strange, unearthly glow over the composition. It at first smells innocent, like fruit dipped in cream and wrapped in a clean, juicy shampoo aura. But then it is also smells musky and honeyed, in a way that's more suggestive of intimacy. What dominates, for us, however, is the exquisite gardenia enfleurage, a costly and rare extraction that yields the only true portrait of gardenia that exists in perfumery. Gardenia lovers take note  this is Holy Grail material: creamy, salty, and with a bodacious meatiness that's soulful without ever tripping over into bleu cheese territory. The astringent pop of saffron adds an undertone of leather and iodine, the tagetes a pungent, hay-like facet  colorful touches of Indian attar perfumery in an otherwise tropical picture. Thanks to these spicy, woody touches, and to the salinity of the gardenia, Lost in Flowers never runs sweet or syrupy. It's not even overtly feminine in the traditional sense. In other words, men  knock yourselves out with this one. It's a stunner, no matter which way you slice it."," Indian red champaca oil, lily of the valley, tagetes (marigold), saffron, gardenia enfleurage, oud",ever try bunch floral perfumes say nope not floral enough let us introduce lose flower remember scene american beauty cheerleader lie bath showered rise petal well replace rose champaca muguet gardenia petal wear lose flower feel like aptly name lose flower sublime experience akin submerge oneself warm bath heady fragrant lifegive flower call joy oil india rare red champaca otto use lose flower casts strange unearthly glow composition first smell innocent like fruit dip cream wrap clean juicy shampoo aura also smell musky honey way suggestive intimacy dominate us however exquisite gardenia enfleurage costly rare extraction yield true portrait gardenia exist perfumery gardenia lover take note holy grail material creamy salty bodacious meatiness soulful without ever tripping bleu cheese territory astringent pop saffron add undertone leather iodine tagetes pungent haylike facet colorful touch indian attar perfumery otherwise tropical picture thanks spicy woody touch salinity gardenia lose flower never run sweet syrupy not even overtly feminine traditional sense word man knock one stunner no matter way slice
dead of night eau de parfum,Strangelove NYC," Dead of Night is an oil-based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled from agarwood trees grown on a sustainably-managed 600-acre plantation in Borneo. It's the equivalent of the Slow Food movement, only in oud terms  no chemical inoculation, no rubbery oud aromachemicals, and little interference from humans. This slow way of farming agarwood produces oud oil that is authentically pungent at first, but quickly softens to reveal the supple, tangy aroma of lambskin freshly cured with hay, herbs, and tea. Polished and set in the frame of a fragrance composition like a jewel, a material like this oud shines. Just keep in mind that this is indeed real oud. Those with little to no experience of oud outside of commercial perfumery might be taken aback at how animalistic and raw the note appears at first, but fear not! In time, the fearsome braggadocio of the opening relaxes into a wonderful aroma of soft leather, delicately sour with accents of dried apricots and fermented tea. Violet leaf and bergamot add freshness to the composition, the crushed greenery and citrus notes mimicking the minty sparkle of agarwood grown on the island of Borneo. The florals are subtly placed so as not to distract from the golden, glowing oud, but a glimpse of rose and jasmine emerges in the heart to sweeten its hay-like tone. Subtle brushstrokes of sandalwood and incense help the oud to fade out gently at the end, but, like a theater star, it lingers for hours on stage, in full knowledge that it's what people really came to see."," Bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud",dead night oilbase fragrance feature organic oud oil distil agarwood tree grow sustainablymanaged 600acre plantation borneo equivalent slow food movement oud term no chemical inoculation no rubbery oud aromachemical little interference human slow way farming agarwood produce oud oil authentically pungent first quickly softens reveal supple tangy aroma lambskin freshly cure hay herbs tea polished set frame fragrance composition like jewel material like oud shine keep mind indeed real oud little no experience oud outside commercial perfumery may take aback animalistic raw note appear first fear not time fearsome braggadocio opening relax wonderful aroma soft leather delicately sour accent dry apricot ferment tea violet leaf bergamot add freshness composition crush greenery citrus note mimicking minty sparkle agarwood grow island borneo floral subtly place not distract golden glow oud glimpse rise jasmine emerge heart sweeten haylike tone subtle brushstroke sandalwood incense help oud fade gently end like theater star linger hour stage full knowledge people really come see
silence the sea eau de parfum,Strangelove NYC," Silence the Sea is the true essence of the sea. Forget the horrors of Calone and sweet aquatics  this scent captures all the stony, mineral silence of a deserted beach in winter. Because it is a brand deeply invested in organic, sustainable raw material production, Strangelove NYC was able to source an ethically-harvested (beach cast) piece of ambergris and use it as the star in this composition. And indeed, it is the strange, salty-sweet airiness of ambergris that dominates here. It floats at the center, emanating an aura of fresh marine air, earth, dried newspapers, tobacco, and even the warm funk of a freshly-cleaned horse stable. Ambergris is, in short, the salty, yeasty smell of a child's head after hours of playing on a cold beach. Cleverly, the perfumer has chosen to not overshadow the ambergris but simply flank its already-complex smell with a host of complimentaryflavors, such as the minty bitterness of angelica, the earthy funk of truffle, and the vegetal, rubbery texture of tuberose. These notes play a valiant second fiddle to the ambergris, emphasizing its flinty, mineral sweetness and extending its unearthly radiance in all directions. Those who love the mysterious, almost indefinable smell of the salt air on a cold beach will adore Silence the Sea."," ambergris, oud, tuber, jasmine, tuberose, angelica",silence sea true essence sea forget horror calone sweet aquatics scent capture stony mineral silence desert beach winter brand deeply invest organic sustainable raw material production strangelove nyc able source ethicallyharveste beach cast piece ambergris use star composition indeed strange saltysweet airiness ambergris dominate float center emanate aura fresh marine air earth dry newspaper tobacco even warm funk freshlycleane horse stable ambergris short salty yeasty smell childs head hour play cold beach cleverly perfumer choose not overshadow ambergris simply flank alreadycomplex smell host complimentaryflavor minty bitterness angelica earthy funk truffle vegetal rubbery texture tuberose note play valiant second fiddle ambergris emphasize flinty mineral sweetness extend unearthly radiance direction love mysterious almost indefinable smell salt air cold beach adore silence sea
melt my heart eau de parfum,Strangelove NYC," A gourmand lover's dream, but really so much more than just a delicious smell, Melt My Heart is an oil-based fragrance that captures the dizzying sensation of falling in love. And if you imagine that to feel like falling slowly backwards into a featherbed filled with fluffy orris butter and dark chocolate, well, then your vision lines right up with that of Strangelove NYC. Creamy, soft, and utterly addictive, this scent combines the mouthfeel of powdered white chocolate and lipstick with the velvety bitterness of 85% cocoa.   Real orris butter, costlier than most other perfumery materials and described by Chandler Burr asliquid good taste, has been used generously here to give the more edible elements spaciousness and lift, like a puff of silvery breath on the cold air. It is thewhite element that contrasts so effectively with the dulcet bitterness of the dark chocolate note. Real oud, ginger, and mandarin are just present enough to draw out various facets of the chocolate and the iris  a spicy, woodsy undertone perhaps - but don't expect too dominant a presence. The sandalwood, in comparison, is a real MVP in this composition, its lush, buttered, coconutty sweetness playing off the dark chocolate and orris to create a delicious Mounds Bar accord that will make you want to nibble your arm. The perfumer, Christophe Laudamiel, says that Melt My Heart isfor falling in love. Well, we can't imagine anyone smelling this and not being helplessly in its thrall."," ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root",gourmand lover dream really much delicious smell melt heart oilbase fragrance capture dizzying sensation fall love imagine feel like fall slowly backwards featherbed fill fluffy orris butter dark chocolate well vision line right strangelove nyc creamy soft utterly addictive scent combine mouthfeel powder white chocolate lipstick velvety bitterness 85 cocoa real orris butter costlier perfumery material describe chandler burr asliquid good taste use generously give edible element spaciousness lift like puff silvery breath cold air thewhite element contrast effectively dulcet bitterness dark chocolate note real oud ginger mandarin present enough draw various facet chocolate iris spicy woodsy undertone perhaps not expect dominant presence sandalwood comparison real mvp composition lush butter coconutty sweetness play dark chocolate orris create delicious mound bar accord make want nibble arm perfumer christophe laudamiel say melt heart isfor fall love well not imagine anyone smell not helplessly thrall

be careful what you wish for parfum extrait,4160 Tuesdays," An oud scent from 4160 Tuesdays? We didn't think it would ever happen, mostly because Sarah herself said it probably wouldn't. After all, with so many companies shoving one oud after another out to market, doing an oud just to do it wouldn't really seem to be on-brand for a perfumer who is forging a wonderful career out of following her own inspirations. But a fateful trip to Dubai left Sarah with some truly exquisite specimens of agarwood extract and, for the first time, she felt the call. So, how to make an oud scent that's also, first and foremost, a 4160 Tuesdays scent? One sniff and the answer is clear. Be Careful What You Wish for is by far the juiciest, fruitiest, most delectably fresh oud we've ever smelled. Energized with tantalizingly tart citrus and shot through with sweet peach, this scent still manages to be as deep, woody and captivating as you could hope for. Five types of real oud will do that, but the balance against the fruit strikes a joyous major chord, while the typical funk of decaying wood is replaced with a grand richness that lasts for untold hours. As tongue-in-cheek as the name may be, if you were wishing for an oud scent that breaks free of convention and exudes real, authentic happiness, 4160 Tuesdays is here to deliver."," Pink grapefruit, juniper berry, peach, white oudh, raspberry, strawberry, gaiac, patchouli, vanilla, plum, dark oudh",oud scent 4160 tuesday not think would ever happen mostly sarah say probably would not many company shove one oud another market oud would not really seem onbrand perfumer forge wonderful career follow inspiration fateful trip dubai left sarah truly exquisite specimen agarwood extract first time feel call make oud scent also first foremost 4160 tuesday scent one sniff answer clear careful wish far juiciest fruity delectably fresh oud ever smell energize tantalizingly tart citrus shoot sweet peach scent still manage deep woody captivate could hope five type real oud balance fruit strike joyous major chord typical funk decay wood replace grand richness last untold hour tongueincheek name may wish oud scent break free convention exude real authentic happiness 4160 tuesday deliver
carlisle eau de parfum,Parfums de Marly," Christened from a majestic 17th-century English steed, Carlisle is a warmly spiced, gourmand-inflected oriental reserved only for the bold. Opening with a colorful burst of juicy, tart green apple spiked with fiery saffron and earthy nutmeg, Carlisle immediately sets itself apart from even Marly's other wondrous gourmands with a grounded, sophisticated earthiness evident from the very first sniff- this is less indulgent dessert pudding and more the aromas of a grand ballroom soiree in full swing, mouthwatering treats mingled with well-groomed aristocracy, elaborate decor and the general spirit of revelry. A richer-yet heart reveals warm, smooth tonka bean and creamy osmanthus- but also gently bitter davana and luscious rose, leading into a true patchouli note that doesn't hold back on the earthiness. However, lovers of Herod and Oajan need not worry, either- alongside that earthy patchouli, a warmly emergent vein of creamy vanilla and sweet opoponax resinoid are every bit as enchantingly seductive as they are in Marly's other masterpieces.

impressions de giverny eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," Impressions de Giverny is a scentscape inspired by Monet's famous gardens at Giverny. The artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a livingen plein air version of his paintings, and so he did. The fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the Giverny garden: first, the famous Japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in Monet's NymphÃ©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. In other words, Impressions de Giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: Japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. The way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. The scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native Japanese fruits and flora. But almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. Threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. There's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. At the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. Finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat  a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. We're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. If you loved Confessions of a Garden Gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling Impressions de Giverny a priority."," Yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",impression de giverny scentscape inspire monet famous gardens giverny artist passionate gardening art want turn garden livingen plein air version painting fragrance cleverly take cue two main area giverny garden first famous japanese water garden bridge water lily feature monet nymphaas series second section thousand small flower plant achieve blurredattheedge impressionistic effect espouse painting style word impression de giverny take inspiration two source japanese botany abstract floral perfumery way two themes intersect beautifully handle scent open crisp almost sour fruity tone zesty yuzu red apple create delicate impression native japanese fruit flora almost immediately sense rugged unpretentious greenery shrub undergrowth shift beneath add earthy undertone thread accord impressionistic swirl flower difficult pick apart certainly combine watery freshness tulip violet leaf denser honey aspect magnolia orange blossom osmanthus creamy warmth floral bouquet feel great skin underscored subtle brushstroke mango ylang peach time also peppery bright thanks fleck lemony coriander fig leaf daubed contrast finally unlike many modern floral solid foundation keep afloat salty musky ambergris benzoin combo not shore floral add touch civety funk picture blow away perfectly perfumer combine minute brushstroke fruit flower greenery come something despite impressionistic abstract form feel utterly coherent skin love confession garden gnome fancy something less herbaceous fruityfloral make sampling impression de giverny priority

fabulous eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Vulgar, shocking, rude, funny, tongue in cheek....no matter what you think of the name, there's no denying that it's got people talking. But in the kerfuffle over the name, has the fragrance itself been a bit overlooked? We think it might have been. The truth is that Fucking Fabulous is very good. It's an edible but fresh suede scent that borrows a bunch of bitter herbs from old school fougeres, scads of buttery tonka from the gourmand category, and wraps it all up in a musky cashmeran glow. And guess what? Totally works.  Clary sage and lavender top out the scent, their clean, smoky greenness meshing seamlessly with plush orris butter to form a leather note that's both soft and aromatic. Lashings of bittersweet almond and tonka bean beneath give the scent a velvety, almost oily-resinous sweetness, like white chocolate melted down with coffee grounds. The fragrance moves between bitter and sweet, herbal and creamy, powdery and oily over the course of the wear, keeping the journey totally interesting for us. Rumor has it that Tom Ford took one whiff of this creation and exclaimed,This is fucking fabulous! We're inclined to agree.

tsuki eau de parfum,Di Ser," Tsuki, meaningmoon, is a wild green scent that captures the thrilling unfamiliarity of Japanese herbs and aromatics. Imagine crushing the leaves of some strange herb between your fingers in the dark and not knowing what it is, exactly. The minty, rosy sting of geranium is clearly identifiable, but you also smell something like crushed lemon balm and coriander beneath that. The aroma is green, minty, herbaceous, citrusy, and also gin-like thanks to a generous dose of juniper berry. But perhaps the most defining feature here is the fresh, vegetal scent of fennel, which gives the background of the scent a lingering anisic sweetness.  Strangely enough, even if you've never been to Japan or smelled Japanese herbs and aromatics before, there is something that marks this scent out as clearly Japanese, rather than Chinese or Indian - possibly its sense of delicacy and restraint. After a bold start, the scent whittles down into a shadowy trace of powdered ginger and licorice root that, although not loud in volume, remains a gentling presence that calms and focuses the mind throughout the day. With its energizing and uplifting qualities, Tsuki is truly a health tonic in scent form: we can imagine it being doled out in therapeutic doses by doctors to tired, stressed-out patients. Detox from the noise of modern life with this wonderful little elixir."," Geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli",tsuki meaningmoon wild green scent capture thrill unfamiliarity japanese herbs aromatics imagine crush leave strange herb finger dark not know exactly minty rosy ste geranium clearly identifiable also smell something like crush lemon balm coriander beneath aroma green minty herbaceous citrusy also ginlike thanks generous dose juniper berry perhaps define feature fresh vegetal scent fennel give background scent linger anisic sweetness strangely enough even never japan smell japanese herbs aromatics something marks scent clearly japanese rather chinese indian possibly sense delicacy restraint bold start scent whittles shadowy trace powder ginger licorice root although not loud volume remain gentle presence calms focus mind throughout day energize uplifting quality tsuki truly health tonic scent form imagine dole therapeutic doses doctor tired stressedout patient detox noise modern life wonderful little elixir
"feb. 14, 1912 eau de parfum",Rundholz Parfums," Warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, Feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. Opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. A distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. And in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most Rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral.

sasora parfum,Di Ser," Sasora, like all other fragrances in the Di Ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. Sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the Kodo ceremony, the art oflistening to Japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. Cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild Hindi oud brought out of the jungles of Assam, in Northern India, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the Arabian Peninsula. The sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. Its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. However, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in Sasora, the perfume.The citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a Zen-like state of bliss. The citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the Himalayas. Both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in Japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a Japanese forest. Considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional Japanese incense sticks. And indeed, Sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from Shoyeido and Baieido  herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. The rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. Real oud oil from noble Assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu  this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office."," Yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",sasora like fragrance di ser range 100 natural feature fine absolute essence available world sasora name one 6 fragrant type aloeswood agarwood traditionally use kodo ceremony art oflistene japanese incense sasora kyara manaban rakoku sumontara managa cool sour sasora think equivalent first fine batches wild hindi oud bring jungles assam northern india distil exclusively use royal family arabian peninsula sasora oud oil use fragrance 100 pure high quality available scent profile boast monastic purity remind kyara especially first moment heated ash mica plate incense however main characteristic sasora herbal sourness quality accentuate sasora perfume citrusy brightness yuzu first buzz palate cleanse mind clutter prepare way zenlike state bliss citrus follow bite greenness camphor medicinal lavenderlike property spikenard herb grow high himalayas camphor spikenard beloved note japanese culture represent herbaceous bitterness snowcovere herbs moss japanese forest consider spiritually cleanse well elevate material typically use flank aloeswood traditional japanese incense stick indeed sasora smell like fine aloeswood incense shoyeido baieido herbal bittersweet spicy medicinal first silky finish sweet powder wood rosewood truly shine frame precious oud oil spikenard spicy aromatic backdrop rosin interior handcarved musical instrument real oud oil noble assamese stock strip leathery animalism polished high shine herbs aromatics yuzu may first oud fragrance tempt wear hot weather even office
kyara parfum,Di Ser," Japanese treatment of agarwood in perfumery is completely different from that of Middle-Eastern perfumery, so let's take a minute to re-set expectations. Since the 6th century AD, the Japanese have used kyara agarwood in the Kodo ceremony (the way of incense), which is the art oflistening to scent. Kyara is a very special type of agarwood. It refers to wood from extremely old, wild-grown agarwood trees in mostly Vietnam, now rare to the point of being extinct. The wordkyara is a description of a scent profile, but also used in grading to mean the highest quality of agarwood. Most authentic kyara pieces were sold to private collectors in Japan, which is how Di Ser came into possession of its own small collection of the precious wood. Kyara is normally heated gently over ash and mica plates as incense; due to its rarity and scarcity, it is never used for distilling oud oil. Until now, that is. In an unprecedented move, Di Ser took the decision to distill oil from its own private collection of kyara. This was an enormously bold and risky undertaking, considering the expense of the raw material, the tiny yield, and the difficulty in extracting oil from such densely-resinated wood. Most oud oil fanatics will never have smelled genuine kyara, either in oil or incense form, so this fragrance, Kyara, is literally the opportunity of a lifetime. The holy grail of oud.  Kyara has a uniquely resinous, green aroma when burned, said to be calming and transporting in equal measure. The opening notes of this 100% natural fragrance are, in fact, pure kyara  verdant, minty, and slightly antiseptic, with the evergreen sting of camphor. Although recognizably oud, the note is as vaporous and clean as early morning mist in a Japanese forest -never dirty or smoky. A massive, gauzy rose note swells up behind the green kyara opening, fleshing out the kyara into a luminous rose-oud concerto against a spicy-woody backdrop that feels like powdered ginger root diffused in sunlight. In keeping with the Japanese classification of oud as rokkoku gomi (meaning ""of six countries"" and the bitter taste fromthe five tastes of sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty), the sweetness and powder is kept in check by the peppery, balsamic-vinegar underbite typical of Vietnamese agarwood. If you've grown weary of oud or simply dislike the more animalic, Arabic treatment of the material, then re-set your nose and give yourself a treat with Kyara, the Japanese silk screen of the oud world. Di Ser's Kyara represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smell authentic kyara agarwood in liquid form  do not cheat yourself of this experience!"," Kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood",japanese treatment agarwood perfumery completely different middleeastern perfumery let us take minute reset expectation since 6th century ad japanese use kyara agarwood kodo ceremony way incense art oflistene scent kyara special type agarwood refer wood extremely old wildgrown agarwood tree mostly vietnam rare point extinct wordkyara description scent profile also use grade mean high quality agarwood authentic kyara piece sell private collector japan di ser come possession small collection precious wood kyara normally heated gently ash mica plate incense due rarity scarcity never use distil oud oil unprecedented move di ser take decision distill oil private collection kyara enormously bold risky undertaking consider expense raw material tiny yield difficulty extract oil denselyresinate wood oud oil fanatic never smell genuine kyara either oil incense form fragrance kyara literally opportunity lifetime holy grail oud kyara uniquely resinous green aroma burn say calm transport equal measure opening note 100 natural fragrance fact pure kyara verdant minty slightly antiseptic evergreen ste camphor although recognizably oud note vaporous clean early morning mist japanese forest never dirty smoky massive gauzy rise note swells behind green kyara opening flesh kyara luminous roseoud concerto spicywoody backdrop feel like powder ginger root diffuse sunlight keep japanese classification oud rokkoku gomi meaning six country bitter taste fromthe five taste sweet bitter sour pungent salty sweetness powder keep check peppery balsamicvinegar underbite typical vietnamese agarwood grow weary oud simply dislike animalic arabic treatment material reset nose give treat kyara japanese silk screen oud world di ser kyara represent onceinalifetime opportunity smell authentic kyara agarwood liquid form not cheat experience
hasunoito parfum,Di Ser," Hasunoito is based on the lotus flower, the symbol of Di Ser and revered throughout Japan, India, and most Eastern Asian countries for its spiritual significance. The oil of both white and pink lotus is so costly and rare that Di Ser has chosen to focus mostly on the abstract idea of a lotus blossom shooting up through the soil, displaying the duality of strength and softness so characteristic of the flower.  And indeed, the first half of the perfume puts forth a convincing portrait of earth. The specific type of agarwood used here smells like cold, damp clay, with a fuzzy golden haze of something medicinal, like flowers dipped into an antiseptic ointment. Boronia absolute, used only in the most luxurious of all-natural perfumery, lends a fresh, spicy-fruity accent, like purple berries doused in wintergreen and clove. Despite the presence of lotus, rose, ylang, and jasmine, nothing about this perfume reads as floral in tone; rather, it smells like a pleasantly earthy, spicy tea filtered through hospital gauze. Arresting, different, and ultimately kind of addictive, Hasunoito is for people who wish to access higher planes of spirituality without going through the more hackneyed route of incense and flowers."," Agarwood (oud), sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose",hasunoito base lotus flower symbol di ser revere throughout japan india eastern asian country spiritual significance oil white pink lotus costly rare di ser choose focus mostly abstract idea lotus blossom shoot soil display duality strength softness characteristic flower indeed first half perfume put forth convincing portrait earth specific type agarwood use smell like cold damp clay fuzzy golden haze something medicinal like flower dip antiseptic ointment boronia absolute use luxurious allnatural perfumery lend fresh spicyfruity accent like purple berry douse wintergreen clove despite presence lotus rise ylang jasmine nothing perfume reads floral tone rather smell like pleasantly earthy spicy tea filter hospital gauze arrest different ultimately kind addictive hasunoito people wish access high plane spirituality without go hackneyed route incense flower
akanesasu eau de parfum,Di Ser," Akane sasu sora,  a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional Japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. It's a phrase imbued with splendor,  suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm,  with awe-inspiring results. To be certain,  a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power,  the same energy,  the same reverence. Luckily,  this eye-openingly bright,  joyous and rich ode to citrus,  jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. As if to mirror the color progression of a sunset,  Akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot,  where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit,  mouthwatering and energizing. A rich,  fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty,  and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth,  leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains,  leaving the sky painted red. A fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation,  Akanesasu is poetry in a bottle."," Orange, Bergamot, Jasmine sambac, Vetiver",akane sasu sora wonderfully evocative phrase use traditional japanese poetry express vivid red glow particularly beautiful sunset phrase imbue splendor suggest unique moment natural world drift especially close supernatural realm aweinspire result certain fragrance draws lovely imagery must contain power energy reverence luckily eyeopeningly bright joyous rich ode citrus jasmine vetiver every bit compelling namesake mirror color progression sunset akanesasu open vivid burst orange bergamot intense green coexist warm orange juicy citrus fruit mouthwatere energize rich fresh jasmine heart nothing heady indolic positively glow quiet majesty emergent vetiver base eschews spiky side note favor gently woodsy warmth leave content relaxation one feel sun dip behind mountain leave sky paint red fragrance summer sunsets moment appreciation akanesasu poetry bottle
shiragoromo parfum,Di Ser," Shiragoromo is an amalgamation of two words, shira (meaning white) and goromo (meaning cloth). White is a sacred color in Japan, even appearing as the main color on the Japanese flag, because it stands for purity and childlike innocence. The fragrance itself also smells clean and pure. Predominantly a simple, natural blend of bright yuzu and earthy green woods, Shiragoromo manages to give the feel of a sun-dappled citrus grove that is nonetheless clearly a Japanese citrus grove.  The opening is both sweet and medicinal - oranges and yuzu with the antiseptic bitterness of green aloeswood lurking directly beneath. The purity of the Di Ser approach to perfumery shines through strongly here and great thought has been given to the balance of all five taste elements of Japanese culture: sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty. It takes a long time for the floral elements to break free of the grip of medicinal yuzu and earthy woods, but finally a clean, radiant white jasmine steps out into the clearing. That the flower feels like an extension of the citrus and woods is testament to both the skill of the perfumer and the delicacy of the jasmine oil used here. If you like the idea of white flower petals filtered through damp, earthy green woods and exuberant citrus, then look to Shiragoromo. It's the rare white floral that doesn't actually behave or smell like one; glimpsed at an oblique angle and shaped into something new by the other materials, Shiragoromo feels like a fresh take on a much-traveled theme."," Agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose",shiragoromo amalgamation two word shira meaning white goromo meaning cloth white sacred color japan even appear main color japanese flag stand purity childlike innocence fragrance also smell clean pure predominantly simple natural blend bright yuzu earthy green wood shiragoromo manage give feel sundapple citrus grove nonetheless clearly japanese citrus grove opening sweet medicinal orange yuzu antiseptic bitterness green aloeswood lurk directly beneath purity di ser approach perfumery shine strongly great think give balance five taste element japanese culture sweet bitter sour pungent salty take long time floral element break free grip medicinal yuzu earthy wood finally clean radiant white jasmine step clearing flower feel like extension citrus wood testament skill perfumer delicacy jasmine oil use like idea white flower petal filter damp earthy green wood exuberant citrus look shiragoromo rare white floral not actually behave smell like one glimpse oblique angle shape something new material shiragoromo feel like fresh take muchtravele theme
suleyman le magnifique eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," The longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleyman I presided over the empire's golden age, marked by massive conquest and expansion, cutting edge political and societal reform, and some of the world's greatest artistic and cultural output- to say nothing of his legendary, passionate love for his wife Roxelana, elevated from his harem to be his queen in bold defiance of tradition and convention. This is the man Rasei Fort pays tribute to with Suleyman le Magnifique, a fragrance that celebrates the Sultan's dynamic complexity by blending notes both softly sweet and ferociously animalic. An amalgamation of florals, spice, incense and resin, it's a powerfully irresistible ode to the opulence of an illustrious empire, contrasting bitter-green galbanum against syrupy amber, earthy patchouli with juicy red apple and fiery cinnamon, all against a backdrop of deep, animalic oud. Luxurious, sumptuous and sophisticated, Suleyman le Magnifique is a truly fitting homage to one of history's great figures."," Galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple",longestreigne sultan ottoman empire suleyman preside empire golden age mark massive conquest expansion cut edge political societal reform world great artistic cultural output say nothing legendary passionate love wife roxelana elevated harem queen bold defiance tradition convention man rasei fort pays tribute suleyman le magnifique fragrance celebrate sultans dynamic complexity blending note softly sweet ferociously animalic amalgamation floral spice incense resin powerfully irresistible ode opulence illustrious empire contrast bittergreen galbanum syrupy amber earthy patchouli juicy red apple fiery cinnamon backdrop deep animalic oud luxurious sumptuous sophisticated suleyman le magnifique truly fitting homage one historys great figure
charlatan eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," From our very first encounter, Fort & Manle has blown us away with their ability to tell wonderfully targeted stories with their scents- tales where the fragrances themselves go far beyond ""matching the mood"" of the copy and become genuine narratives in their own right. Charlatan, a tale of seduction, deception, betrayal, and sin, is by these standards truly a masterwork. Opening with sweetly soft, romantic pear dipped in luscious chocolate, the opening notes evoke a gentle and charming courtship. Even as an element of carnality is introduced via black Perigord truffle, it builds into a passionate symphony of Damascene rose and a lush supporting floral cast, a flirtation exploded into a full-blown romance. Only as a deeply earthy amber and surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter the picture do we see the twist- an element of danger has saturated our storybook, and the elaborate bouquet may contain poison at the center. But then again, some lovers thrive on the edge.

confessions of a garden gnome eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," One does not often consider the humble nobility of the garden gnome, and yet his stoicism in the face of the ever-changing seasons is, in its own way, quite beautiful. Confessions of a Garden Gnome pays tribute to this stalwart steward of your backyard, whisking us through a whimsically enchanting year's worth of weather in a single spray, an experience that proves to be as creative and delightful as any we've had in niche fragrance. Confessions opens in springtime, a crisp, green breeze of yuzu-inflected bergamot atop a dewey musk. Summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris. Ultimately, the darkening wood notes lead into winter, while glowing amber suggests the warmth and comfort lurking just out of reach of our heroic gnome, frozen as he is to his territory. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, an ever-evolving fragrant experience that must be worn to be believed.

fatih sultan mehmed eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," A tribute to the opulence and glory of the Ottoman Sultanic Empire, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of Mehmed the Conqueror. Crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush Damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. Finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental.

harem rose eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," A soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? With Harem Rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. Yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the Damascene Rose that Rasei Fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. The result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose.

maduro eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," In 1961, a Cuban cargo ship, the Reina del Mar, was intercepted by Barbadian pirates on its way to the United States. The ship was scuttled in the ocean and its cargo- tropical fruits and, more importantly, a crate of rare, priceless Cohiba Maduro cigars- sank to the bottom of the ocean. With Maduro, Fort & Manle reimagine the deep, intoxicating aroma of that cargo hold as an explosion of herbaceous spice, fruit, and rich tobacco, a smoky-sweet woody gourmand with unparalleled depth. Clean, vibrant fruit and spice collide with rich, resinous amber, earthy patchouli is smoothed with warm vanilla and woods, and at the center, an intriguingly complex tobacco- dry and spicy one moment, sweet and musty the next. The Reina del Mar may have shipwrecked, but Maduro, the fragrance it inspired, is a magnificent vessel indeed."," Basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, atlas cedar",1961 cuban cargo ship reina del mar intercept barbadian pirate way united state ship scuttle ocean cargo tropical fruit importantly crate rare priceless cohiba maduro cigars sank bottom ocean maduro fort manle reimagine deep intoxicate aroma cargo hold explosion herbaceous spice fruit rich tobacco smokysweet woody gourmand unparalleled depth clean vibrant fruit spice collide rich resinous amber earthy patchouli smooth warm vanilla wood center intriguingly complex tobacco dry spicy one moment sweet musty next reina del mar may shipwreck maduro fragrance inspire magnificent vessel indeed
bojnokopff eau de parfum,Fort & Manle," An extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution Russia's master illusionists, Bojnokopff (formerly titled Mr. Bojnokopff's Purple Hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. Our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean French lavender. As the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of Belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. As the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. Who is the mysterious Mr. Bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? Would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?"," Oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",extravagant homage showmanship prerevolution russias master illusionist bojnokopff formerly title mr bojnokopff purple hat throwback sweet smoky darkly woodsy gourmand defie characterization even enchant encounter grand illusion open deep dark oud note pungent enough avoid dread medicinal tag pleasantly balance wispy wood smoke complementary vein smooth clean french lavender act progress smoke pour titular hat begin thicken billow take warm creaminess vanilla indulgent richness belgian chocolate simultaneously mouthwatere harmony everpresent oud seductively mysterious smoke fills stage deep spicy woodsiness prevail gaiac cedar combine almost oily vetiver delightful effect smoke finally clear hat remain stage mysterious mr bojnokopff magical fragrance deliciously gourmand seductively woodsy would really want spoil illusion find
slowdive eau de parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes," Is the name of Hiram Green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to Slowdive, the seminal UK shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? The perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the Indian summer air is almost palpable."" But it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling Green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. This is the feeling of Slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. The result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of Hiram Green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. While the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve."," Neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",name hiram greens late allnatural stunner reference slowdive seminal uk shoegaze band recently make triumphant return record twodecade absence perfumer note vague reference mood languid afternoon sweetness indian summer air almost palpable not like two concept unrelated good shoegaze music lot like feel green describe intense steady hum warmth light almost embryonic soothe envelopment feel slowdive richly honey bouquet potent white floral hazily syrupy mouthwateringly sweet spicyfloral tobacco blossom feature center result gloriously carefully balance overdrive olfactive noise fuzz ambere resinous fruit lush narcotic floral invigorate spice new example hiram greens remarkable ability make disarmingly complex natural fragrance without limitation connection fragrance band remain appropriately blurry not help feel would approve
baque parfum extrait,Slumberhouse," We'd heard talk of Baque, a long-discontinued Slumberhouse original that pre-dated our relationship with Josh Lobb's tantalizing creations, but truth be told, we weren't too worried about it. How could a different Slumberhouse tobacco scent steal our hearts away from the mouthwatering fruit-laced smoking pipe of Kiste, or the smoky-sweet darkness of (dearly departed) Jeke? But now, Baque is, well, back, and we're delighted to discover that it's a dynamic, vividly-painted tobacco scent that lands squarely in the middle of our two previous favorites. Combining syrupy, fruity apricot with sweet, spicy tobacco and a deep strain of boozy richness, Baque hypnotizes and delights, seduces and compels, and most importantly, draws us deep within an vivid, gorgeous imaginary landscape as only Slumberhouse can."," Apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment",would hear talk baque longdiscontinue slumberhouse original predate relationship josh lobb tantalizing creation truth tell not worried could different slumberhouse tobacco scent steal heart away mouthwatere fruitlace smoking pipe kiste smokysweet darkness dearly depart jeke baque well back delighted discover dynamic vividlypainte tobacco scent land squarely middle two previous favorite combine syrupy fruity apricot sweet spicy tobacco deep strain boozy richness baque hypnotizes delight seduce compel importantly draws us deep within vivid gorgeous imaginary landscape slumberhouse
camel extrait de parfum,Zoologist," Camel is a series of elegant contradictions. Technically, it's an oriental, but in sidestepping all of the clichÃ©s of the genre, it retains a surprisingly brisk, fat-free mien. It features a plethora of rich, sticky notes like dates and dried fruit, but is as dry as a glass of champagne. Frankincense, musk, and oud lend a sinuous exoticism that speaks to the East; yet Camel has a distinctly retro flourish that places it firmly among the flanks of classic French perfumes such as My Sin and Arpege. We sense several shifting layers of scent in Camel, all of them fascinating. First, a topnote of dried fruit dipped in green frankincense sets the pace: resinous, rich, but also dry, tart almost. Imagine the steamy sweetness of dried apricots and plums laid out in a souk, pricked by the waxy sourness of preserved lemons and pickled mangoes just beneath. The mouthwatering notes of the opening give way to an animalic floral heart  a none-too-clean jasmine and orange blossom whipped into a soapy, leathery froth by civet and musk. All this is spread over a gritty amber drydown that manages to smell like the friction between hot sand, cold soap, and silk sheets. Although Camel strikes us as more Madame Bovary than Scheherazade, it nonetheless manages to capture the contradictory nature of the camel, itself permanently poised between froideur and rage."," Dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver",camel series elegant contradiction technically oriental sidestep clichas genre retain surprisingly brisk fatfree mien feature plethora rich sticky note like date dry fruit dry glass champagne frankincense musk oud lend sinuous exoticism speak east yet camel distinctly retro flourish place firmly among flank classic french perfumes sin arpege sense several shift layer scent camel fascinating first topnote dry fruit dip green frankincense set pace resinous rich also dry tart almost imagine steamy sweetness dry apricot plum lay souk prick waxy sourness preserve lemon pickle mangoes beneath mouthwatere note opening give way animalic floral heart nonetooclean jasmine orange blossom whip soapy leathery froth civet musk spread gritty amber drydown manage smell like friction hot sand cold soap silk sheet although camel strike us madame bovary scheherazade nonetheless manage capture contradictory nature camel permanently poise froideur rage

arabians,Montale," Arabians is about capturing that feeling of royal adventure, with wind in your hair and a lover by your side.

This is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old.

black vanilla eau de parfum,Mancera," Black Vanilla by Mancera is a milky floral vanilla that soothes rather than challenges, which is exactly what we all need every now and then. Soft hints of blackcurrants, coconut, and peach cast a gauzy veil of fruit over the vanilla accord, itself sheer and barely sweet, like coconut milk put through a milk frother. The juicy berries and peach lend a discreetly flirtatious vibe, but in general, the lack of syrupy sweetness marks this out as a refined, grown-up vanilla scent.  In time, a powdery rose emerges from the peachy, berried vanilla froth, creamy puffs of jasmine petals and candied violet trailing soon after. The florals, diffused in an enormous cloud of soapy white musk, feel more like a swirl of expensive cosmetic powder than freshly-cut flowers, giving the scent a distinctly clean, feminine vibe. In terms of sillage and longevity, Black Vanilla lasts the day, but is soft rather than loud. Despite the name, therefore, Black Vanilla is truly a perfect fragrance for days when you need your scent to stay low-key but still smell amazing. Gently feminine, its cluster of powdery flowers, musk, and lightly frothed vanilla-coconut milk feels more like a perfect veil of milky, floral lotion rather than a full-on perfume."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk",black vanilla mancera milky floral vanilla soothes rather challenge exactly need every soft hint blackcurrant coconut peach cast gauzy veil fruit vanilla accord sheer barely sweet like coconut milk put milk frother juicy berry peach lend discreetly flirtatious vibe general lack syrupy sweetness marks refined grownup vanilla scent time powdery rise emerge peachy berried vanilla froth creamy puffs jasmine petal candy violet trail soon floral diffuse enormous cloud soapy white musk feel like swirl expensive cosmetic powder freshlycut flower give scent distinctly clean feminine vibe term sillage longevity black vanilla last day soft rather loud despite name therefore black vanilla truly perfect fragrance day need scent stay lowkey still smell amazing gently feminine cluster powdery flower musk lightly froth vanillacoconut milk feel like perfect veil milky floral lotion rather fullon perfume
red tobacco eau de parfum,Mancera," Red Tobacco by Mancera is an incredibly potent, sexy tobacco fragrance with enough spice to turn the heat up on a cold winter's night. The opening is deceptively sharp and fresh, a one-two punch of leathery saffron and crisp apple, bathed in a haze of that smoky, medicinal Mancera oud. This phase smells like oud chips fermenting in a vat of honey  medicinal, slightly pungent, and deliciously sweet-n-sour. But it's not long before the scent shakes off any semblance of freshness and melts into a thick, juicy amber that smells like a river of molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco, dried plums, and fruitcake. Red Tobacco is so confidently spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon, it practically sizzles. With time, the sweet, rich pipe tobacco emerges from its bed of amber and spice to reveal itself as the true star. The bombastic sweetness of the scent is toned down a little by the slightly dirty, smoky oud note and a patchouli note that smells like damp dark chocolate. A naughty little cousin to Montale's Honey Aoud, Red Tobacco will warm your bones in winter and the blood of anyone who picks up your scent."," Saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, Haitian vetiver, Madagascar vanilla, white musk",red tobacco mancera incredibly potent sexy tobacco fragrance enough spice turn heat cold winter night opening deceptively sharp fresh onetwo punch leathery saffron crisp apple bathe haze smoky medicinal mancera oud phase smell like oud chip ferment vat honey medicinal slightly pungent deliciously sweetnsour not long scent shake semblance freshness melt thick juicy amber smell like river molten honeycomb course around pipe tobacco dry plum fruitcake red tobacco confidently spice nutmeg cinnamon practically sizzles time sweet rich pipe tobacco emerge bed amber spice reveal true star bombastic sweetness scent toned little slightly dirty smoky oud note patchouli note smell like damp dark chocolate naughty little cousin montale honey aoud red tobacco warm bone winter blood anyone pick scent
california snow eau de parfum,A Lab on Fire," California Snow crackles with the electricity of a soirÃ©e high in the Hollywood Hills. White-blonde starlets loll on the lawn, rolling joints and listening to the sound of the coyotes. Studio execs, excited by the snowy mounds of illicit substances on every surface, long to engage. But the scent of the hot night air  earth, sage, cannabis  is too bewitching to focus on anything else. California Snow's glossy, filmed-in-HD surface belies a certainearth mother wildness. A rose so bright and crisp it smells more like an apple is the first surprise; the damp earthiness of the soil tincture the second. The combination of the crystalline with the muddy is utterly charming, like a glammed-up cool kid suddenly locating their hippy side, and kicking off their Jimmy Choos to roll around in the dirt. A witchy sage works with aromatic hay, chamomile, and wild mountain tea to dry out the scent, turning it from earthy and wet into something you might crumble up and smoke. It finishes as a gust of warm, grassy desert air off the scrublands high up in the Hollywood Hills. With its clever contrasting of crisp, clean notes with grungy, earthy ones, California Snow is provocative in a good-humored way, like a star who chooses to pair a pristine white tuxedo with beaten-up plimsolls for a red carpet event."," Sage, tea, chamomile, coumarin, narcissus, rose, hay, cannabis, musk, soil tincture, vetiver, cedar",california snow crackle electricity soirae high hollywood hill whiteblonde starlet loll lawn roll joint listen sound coyote studio execs excited snowy mound illicit substance every surface long engage scent hot night air earth sage cannabis bewitching focus anything else california snow glossy filmedinhd surface belie certainearth mother wildness rise bright crisp smell like apple first surprise damp earthiness soil tincture second combination crystalline muddy utterly charming like glammedup cool kid suddenly locate hippy side kick jimmy choos roll around dirt witchy sage work aromatic hay chamomile wild mountain tea dry scent turn earthy wet something may crumble smoke finish gust warm grassy desert air scrubland high hollywood hill clever contrast crisp clean note grungy earthy one california snow provocative goodhumore way like star choose pair pristine white tuxedo beatenup plimsoll red carpet event

not a perfume eau de parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"If my different creations had one thing in common, it would be the presence of an ingredient I am particularly fond of. Overdosed in Lady V and Calamity J, more discrete in Miss Charming and Citizen Queen, I use it regularly to bring elegance to my creations because of its unique and inimitable woody, musky finesse. So, this time I have created a perfume out of this one ingredient - a perfume that wouldn't be in the conventional sense of the term.  I will leave you to discover it on your skin because it is only through contact that its secrets will be unveiled."" Romano Ricci, FounderAlong with today's minimalist trend, Not a Perfume follows suit and adds extremity, irreverence and conceptual characteristics to deliver a true art form. You have now stepped into a new and elegant form of perfumery. With Not a Perfume you get exactly what you want from the scent: it does not evolve; it is not a composition, but rather a particular fragrance that is very strong & lasting on skin. Just like the white packaging it's housed in, its makeup is fresh, clean, and clinical. This brand new concept from Romano Ricci is a modern day fragrance that is 100% synthetic and created without allergens. Not a Perfume is made of 1 single synthetic ingredient Cetalox. Cetalox is a molecular creation that comes from the organic research. Developed by Firmenich in the 1950's to replace Ambergris, a very rare natural secretion of whales, Ambroxan comes in the form of white crystals.

mx. eau de parfum,ERIS Parfums," PronouncedMix, Mx. is named after the gender neutral title replacing Mr., Mrs. and Ms., announces a new gender fluid era where perfumes are not rigidly gendered. ""X"" marks the spot of freedom.True to form, Mx. doesn't abstain from taking a position on gender  it leaves all options open. Mx. dances between sweet creaminess and brusque, aromatic woods, playing both sides of the fence with perfect poise and balance. Its mouthwatering, almost gourmand opening salvo of peppery saffron fits neatly over a heart of rugged Australian sandalwood and cedar spiked with black pepper, ginger, cacao and frankincense.Dabs of castoreum and birch tar in the base draw all the other notes together in a sensual embrace, sending a haze of smoke and leather up through the nutty, earthy sandalwood. A crÃ¨me brulÃ©e of whipped woods, saffron, incense, and smoke, Mx. is the fragrance equivalent of a soft feminine face being kissed all over by a masculine, stubbled one. We defy you to put it on and not shiver with pleasure."," Indian ginger, Madagascar black pepper, saffron, Ethiopian olibanum, Australian sandalwood, Virginian cedarwood, Haitian vetiver, Indonesian patchouli, Laotian benzoin, Russian birch tar, Venezuelan cacao, castoreum",pronouncedmix mx name gender neutral title replace mr mrs ms announce new gender fluid era perfumes not rigidly gendered x marks spot freedom true form mx not abstain take position gender leave option open mx dance sweet creaminess brusque aromatic wood play side fence perfect poise balance mouthwatere almost gourmand opening salvo peppery saffron fit neatly heart rugged australian sandalwood cedar spike black pepper ginger cacao frankincense dabs castoreum birch tar base draw note together sensual embrace send haze smoke leather nutty earthy sandalwood cra brulae whip wood saffron incense smoke mx fragrance equivalent soft feminine face kiss masculine stubble one defy put not shiver pleasure
monstera eau de parfum,Xinu," Monstera pays tribute to the scent of Monstera Deliciosa (Delicious Monster), a lush plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southern Mexico. Although Monstera produces fruit, the focus here is on the green, aromatic scent of the leaves, stem, and plant itself.When talking about green scents, it's important to define the type of greenness  green perfumes can smell vegetal, herbaceous, bitter, dewy, bitter, or waxy depending on the notes used. What's astonishing about Monstera is just how juicy and lush the greenery smells here, like a leaf that's been snapped open, allowing great big droplets of plant juice and sap to seep out. The scent supports the crunchy greenery with an accord that smells like damp earth, bitter moss, and the sharpness of a pineapple-like note from the Monstera fruit. In its final movement, orchid and datura lend a subtly creamy white floral tone, the orchid in particular giving the scent a hint of bitter cocoa and vanilla. But in general, the aromatic greenery of a Mexican jungle is what lingers here, both in the mind and on the skin. Monstera is a leafy green scent that never once loses its focus, for a result that's both beautiful and technically impressive."," Leaves and fruit of Monstera, sacred ear flowers, white datura, bullhorn orchid",monstera pays tribute scent monstera deliciosa delicious monster lush plant native tropical rainforest southern mexico although monstera produce fruit focus green aromatic scent leave stem plant talk green scent important define type greenness green perfumes smell vegetal herbaceous bitter dewy bitter waxy depend note use astonishing monstera juicy lush greenery smell like leaf snap open allow great big droplet plant juice sap seep scent support crunchy greenery accord smell like damp earth bitter moss sharpness pineapplelike note monstera fruit final movement orchid datura lend subtly creamy white floral tone orchid particular give scent hint bitter cocoa vanilla general aromatic greenery mexican jungle linger mind skin monstera leafy green scent never lose focus result beautiful technically impressive
oronardo eau de parfum,Xinu," OroNardo is a word that combines two Spanish words: nardo, which means tuberose, the famously fleshy white flower that's native to Mexico, and oro, meaning gold, hence OroNardo (Golden Tuberose).Being both Mexican and famous for his lyrical treatment of white florals, it is no surprise that Rodrigo Flores-Roux is able to pay proper tribute to the gorgeous Mexican tuberose. First, he flanks the tuberose with a very indolic mock orange - a sweet-smelling white flower that smells like jasmine petals dipped in honey  to accentuate its naturally fleshy sexiness. Then he draws out its green, camphoraceous freshness through judicious use of marigold, a spicy, herbaceous flower with a twinge of vegetal bitterness. The result captures the totality of the freshly-plucked flower  tuber, stems, petals, leaves and all. The texture of OroNardo is also a delight, transitioning gracefully from whipped cream to a breeze of golden, pollinated powder. Delicate and green rather than heavy, OroNardo shows that, in the right hands, tuberose doesn't have to be the show-stopping monster it's often reputed to be."," Mock orange, floral notes, marigold, tuberose, white nerium oleander",oronardo word combine two spanish word nardo mean tuberose famously fleshy white flower native mexico oro meaning gold hence oronardo golden tuberose mexican famous lyrical treatment white floral no surprise rodrigo floresroux able pay proper tribute gorgeous mexican tuberose first flank tuberose indolic mock orange sweetsmelle white flower smell like jasmine petal dip honey accentuate naturally fleshy sexiness draws green camphoraceous freshness judicious use marigold spicy herbaceous flower twinge vegetal bitterness result capture totality freshlyplucked flower tuber stem petal leave texture oronardo also delight transitioning gracefully whip cream breeze golden pollinate powder delicate green rather heavy oronardo show right hand tuberose not showstoppe monster often repute
fumabat eau de parfum,Couteau de Poche," Fumabat: an unusual name for unusual perfume. Parid Cefa takes familiar materials  pine, carnation, frankincense, patchouli  and rearranges them in a novel way that that you don't smell what you're expecting to smell. Expectations are upended. For example, despite the presence of mint, green tea, and galbanum in the topnotes, Fumabat is neither green nor particularly fresh.Instead, it's a tarry spice oriental with a big old school drydown of oakmoss, patchouli, and soapy leather. Surprised that fragrances with such throwback appeal are being produced in small artist's ateliers in Brooklyn? Yeah, so are we. In a good way. For all its retro style, Fumabat feels exciting and new. We are taken on a dizzyingly ride from spicy carnation, oakmoss, and galbanum, which appear to reference classic perfumery, to exotic, smoky frankincense, which brings us straight to the sultan's harem, and even detouring briefly to a grungy, 1970's style patch. Somehow, Fumabat manages to pull everything together brilliantly, as if perfumery had always been missing a vital piece of the puzzle  Arabian Nights meets Burt Reynolds  and this brand stepped in to provide it."," Green tea, galbanum, mint absolute, Bulgarian black pine, carnation, Somalian frankincense, vetiver root, leather, oakmoss, patchouli",fumabat unusual name unusual perfume parid cefa take familiar material pine carnation frankincense patchouli rearrange novel way not smell expect smell expectation upended example despite presence mint green tea galbanum topnote fumabat neither green particularly fresh instead tarry spice oriental big old school drydown oakmoss patchouli soapy leather surprised fragrance throwback appeal produce small artist atelier brooklyn yeah good way retro style fumabat feel exciting new take dizzyingly ride spicy carnation oakmoss galbanum appear reference classic perfumery exotic smoky frankincense bring us straight sultans harem even detour briefly grungy 1970s style patch somehow fumabat manage pull everything together brilliantly perfumery always miss vital piece puzzle arabian night meet burt reynolds brand step provide
aguamadera eau de parfum,Xinu," Aguamadera is an amalgamation of two words in Spanish: agua for water, and madera for wood, thus Aguamadera meaningwaterwood. This name makes sense when you consider that this is a scent based on the scent of agave, a tough succulent native to Mexico whose hard, spiky leaves give us both agave syrup and mezcal. The mezcal theme is fully explored in Aguamadera, with a lime note up top that's so tart it almost draws saliva from the mouth. There's a hit of salt with an outdoorsy freshness that recalls a gust of sea air. All this might be written off as just another riff on a summer freshie were it not for the incredible woody notes that form the ballast of the scent   guaiac wood gives the scent the smokey agave spirit of mezcal, and cedarwood a nuance of sweat-lodge coziness that lends enormous charm and warmth. The woods are more creamy than dry or radiant, which works exceptionally well against the spikier salt and citrus notes. If you're in the market for a tangy, citrusy fragrance with a natural, non-abrasive woody drydown that goes on forever, then Aguamadera should be on your radar."," Agave, lime, guaiac wood, cedar",aguamadera amalgamation two word spanish agua water madera wood thus aguamadera meaningwaterwood name make sense consider scent base scent agave tough succulent native mexico whose hard spiky leave give us agave syrup mezcal mezcal theme fully explore aguamadera lime note top tart almost draws saliva mouth hit salt outdoorsy freshness recall gust sea air may write another riff summer freshie not incredible woody note form ballast scent guaiac wood give scent smokey agave spirit mezcal cedarwood nuance sweatlodge coziness lend enormous charm warmth wood creamy dry radiant work exceptionally well spiky salt citrus note market tangy citrusy fragrance natural nonabrasive woody drydown go forever aguamadera radar
copala eau de parfum,Xinu," Copala focuses on copal resin, used as incense by the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America since the time of the Mayan civilization. Black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. Here, it is the good-natured sweetness of Mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. The faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. Smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry Mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. Instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. What's most impressive about Copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the XinÃº rendition is positively monastic."," Pink pepper, copal, mesquite, Mexican vanilla",copala focus copal resin use incense indigenous people mexico central america since time mayan civilization black copal heavy rich know bittersweet bay leaf scent golden copal smooth sweet honey goodnature sweetness mexican golden copal give dry incensey vanilla edge faintly cinnamonandbayleaf spiciness inherent resin firmly underline piquant pink pepper note run way spine scent base smoky mesquite wood keep sultry mexican vanilla powdery elegant no gluttony sugar excess instead dark cocoaish tone develop give woody vanilla dustiness reminiscent white ash left copal burns clean away impressive copala lightness naturalness compare spicy vanilla oriental xinao rendition positively monastic
french affair eau de parfum,Ex Nihilo," French Affair pays tribute to the fiercely elegant chypres of Paris in the 1970's  earthy, mossy affairs worn by the free-thinkers of the world who strolled through the Left Bank like they owned it. And they did. Women in Le Smoking tuxedos unbuttoned to the navel, men in full-on Oscar Wilde mode: nonconformists who smelled of Gauloises smoke, crushed velvet, and Aramis 900. But French Affair is no nu-chypre pretender. It is authentically, damply, unmistakably oakmoss-y, with that familiar inky feel that gives chypres their backbone. A rich wave of Indonesian patchouli - earthy and camphoraceous - jumps out at you from the topnotes, riding hand in hand with the moss to create an accord of coppery, freshly-turned soil. The lychee note smells more like overripe plum, momentarily sweetening the earthier notes. Violet leaf streaks across the loamy gloom, as surprising as a camera flash. But the dark, musty earth notes are what prevail  a bolt of black velvet unfolded after many years in storage. Eventually, this accord reveals a spiced, plummy rose and a pungent cedary drydown that is both aromatic and slightly sweaty. French Affair stands shoulder to shoulder with the great patchouli chypres of the 1970's, Aramis 900, Aromatics Elixir, and Givenchy Gentleman. Close your eyes and breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke floating through velvet collars soaked in patchouli. Dark, moody, and viciously sexy, French Affair is indeed a very French Affair."," bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, Atlas cedar, angelica, pepper, Indonesian patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss",french affair pays tribute fiercely elegant chypre paris 1970s earthy mossy affair wear freethinker world stroll left bank like woman le smoking tuxedo unbuttoned navel man fullon oscar wilde mode nonconformist smell gauloise smoke crush velvet aramis 900 french affair no nuchypre pretender authentically damply unmistakably oakmossy familiar inky feel give chypre backbone rich wave indonesian patchouli earthy camphoraceous jumps topnote ride hand hand moss create accord coppery freshlyturne soil lychee note smell like overripe plum momentarily sweeten earthy note violet leaf streaks across loamy gloom surprising camera flash dark musty earth note prevail bolt black velvet unfolded many year storage eventually accord reveal spice plummy rise pungent cedary drydown aromatic slightly sweaty french affair stand shoulder shoulder great patchouli chypre 1970s aramis 900 aromatics elixir givenchy gentleman close eye breathe smell cigarette smoke float velvet collar soak patchouli dark moody viciously sexy french affair indeed french affair
note de yuzu eau de parfum,HEELEY," In Japan, when the yuzu citrus ripens in winter, traditional baths are taken with the whole yuzu fruits floating in the water, imparting their delightful scent and invigorating the senses. Note de Yuzu, Heeley's collaboration with the Tokyo-Parisian fashion house and music label Maison KitsunÃ© takes the yuzu bath as the perfect point of departure to encapsulate British, French, and Japanese influences into a sparkling, soothing, sensual fragrance.  Note de Yuzu opens as exuberantly as a bottle of champagne, the celebratory pop filling the air with effervescent droplets. The energy and zest of Japanese yuzu are drenched in hydration with tart lemon and fruity mandarine. As the immediate fruity freshness softens, the gentle marine notes unfold like saltwater on skin, reminiscent of Heeley's iconic Sel Marin, but with a clean, sensual white musk base. Note de Yuzu is a charming tonic for the senses, imparting that cool-kid vibe of relaxed chic done right."," Yuzu, lemon, mandarine, sea salt, vetiver, white musk",japan yuzu citrus ripens winter traditional bath take whole yuzu fruit float water impart delightful scent invigorate sense note de yuzu heeley collaboration tokyoparisian fashion house music label maison kitsuna take yuzu bath perfect point departure encapsulate british french japanese influence sparkle soothe sensual fragrance note de yuzu open exuberantly bottle champagne celebratory pop fill air effervescent droplet energy zest japanese yuzu drench hydration tart lemon fruity mandarine immediate fruity freshness softens gentle marine note unfold like saltwater skin reminiscent heeley iconic sel marin clean sensual white musk base note de yuzu charming tonic sense impart coolkid vibe relaxed chic right

oud stars - ceylon eau de parfum,Xerjoff," While tea scents are often thought of as delicate and ethereal, there's no reason why that must be so- tea, after all, is a dynamic substance, equally capable of powerful richness and deeply spiced aromas.

This is the beauty of Ceylon, a scent that dares to surround exquisite black tea from Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) with decadently luxurious oriental and gourmand notes, producing a sumptuous tea scent unlike any other.Ceylon opens with a sweetly honeyed drop of bergamot, which quickly smooths the way for the tea at the center of the show- jet-black, richly toasted, and the perfect compliment to a sensually smooth blend of Malaysian oud and Indian sandalwood. As a mouthwatering vanilla and powdery amber emerge, the notes blend with astonishing balance, leaving the tea as the unifying note between sweet, creamy, powdered, woodsy and balsamic elements. As complex as it sounds, it wears like a dream.

bruma eau de parfum,Cire Trudon," Bruma meanssolstice in Latin, which brings to mind something one might wear to a pagan ritual or to howl at the moon. But the word Bruma' is also close to the French word brume for mist, and we think that this word fits the scent better. It begins with a gentle misting of iris, violets, and peony, all swirled together into a creamy, fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum, part lipstick. A rooty iris stands at the center, quietly gathering itself up into a soft leather, aided by black pepper, which accentuates the naturally rubbery facets of peony. Thanks to a touch of lavender and galbanum, the suede or leather accord grows ashier, greener, and drier, the ghost of Tuscan Leather flickering at the edges. It is only after a while that one begins to notice the delicious creaminess of the base coming forward: damp jasmine petals pressed into spicy, milky tonka bean and the saltwater taffy of labdanum. All the while, Bruma retains a delightfully gauzy texture, which makes it an easy wear, even in hot weather. The lingering impression is of a fruity violet suede accord over dry ash, resin, and finally, the nutty, baked hay smell of tonka and vetiver. It is not the striding Valkyrie implied by the name; but for days when you want to smell just plain amazing rather than fierce, Bruma is the perfect choice."," black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean",bruma meanssolstice latin bring mind something one may wear pagan ritual howl moon word bruma also close french word brume mist think word fit scent well begin gentle mist iris violet peony swirl together creamy fluffy cosmetic accord part lokhoum part lipstick rooty iris stand center quietly gather soft leather aid black pepper accentuate naturally rubbery facet peony thanks touch lavender galbanum suede leather accord grow ashier greener drier ghost tuscan leather flickering edges one begin notice delicious creaminess base come forward damp jasmine petal press spicy milky tonka bean saltwater taffy labdanum bruma retain delightfully gauzy texture make easy wear even hot weather linger impression fruity violet suede accord dry ash resin finally nutty baked hay smell tonka vetiver not stride valkyrie imply name day want smell plain amazing rather fierce bruma perfect choice
ii (deux) eau de parfum,Cire Trudon," II, or Deux (French for two), is all about new beginnings: the second act, rebirth, regeneration. Essentially, Deux is an aromatic scent filled to brimming with the piercingly green smell of regrowth  fig saplings, plants, and young conifers pushing their way up through layers of humus and pine needles to meet the sun. With lots of aromatic juniper and bitter orange, it is brisk and unsentimental, an impression confirmed by its salty, woody musk in the drydown. Like all the perfumes in the Cire Trudon range, it is perfectly unisex. Although not listed, we smell a lot of kitchen garden notes in here too, particularly the resinous snap of tomato leaf, mint, basil, and the milky juice of fresh fig leaf. The vibrant, stemmy smell of crushed leaves is intoxicating, bringing back memories of small, childish hands stained green with plant juice. This is a scent that crawls with life. Wearing it, you can almost sitting in a forest clearing, face turned to the sun, surrounded by the fertile smell of tender green shoots and leaves pushing up to the surface, like a fast motion sequence on a nature documentary. Deux is the perfect fragrance with which to welcome in the rites of spring and drive away the cold stoniness of winter. Bristling with verdant energy, think of Deux as a shot of antioxidant-rich green juice to stimulate the blood and re-start the engine."," green leaves, orange bigarade, pine, pepper, juniper, cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran",ii deux french two new beginning second act rebirth regeneration essentially deux aromatic scent fill brim piercingly green smell regrowth fig sapling plant young conifer push way layer humus pine needles meet sun lot aromatic juniper bitter orange brisk unsentimental impression confirm salty woody musk drydown like perfumes cire trudon range perfectly unisex although not list smell lot kitchen garden note particularly resinous snap tomato leaf mint basil milky juice fresh fig leaf vibrant stemmy smell crush leave intoxicate bring back memories small childish hand stain green plant juice scent crawl life wear almost sit forest clearing face turn sun surround fertile smell tender green shoot leave push surface like fast motion sequence nature documentary deux perfect fragrance welcome rite spring drive away cold stoniness winter bristle verdant energy think deux shoot antioxidantrich green juice stimulate blood restart engine
mortel eau de parfum,Cire Trudon," Mortel proves there's a reason why incense has been burned in churches for thousands of years: it just smells darned good. Yes, incense is used to purify the air and to rid places of worship of bad spirits. But the truth of the matter is that the scent of frankincense, labdanum, myrrh, and benzoin is almost universally pleasing. The question then becomes how to build an incense fragrance in a way that it stands out from countless others in the genre. Some use room-filling synthetics to lift the resins, some are dense and airless, and some are airy, bright  almost soapy. Mortel is a bone-dry, monastic take on the theme, differing from other entries in the field by being both wearable (in a casual, everyday sense) and supremely natural in feel. It skips entirely the lime-peel brightness of the topnotes of frankincense, plunging instead directly towards a heart of dark, waxy, smoked-out resin, with a vein of sizzling black pepper. The structure stacks churchy resins around a core of extremely dry labdanum, which here completely lacks the friendlier caramelic tones of its usual presentation. Myrrh, licorice-like and earthy, is particularly prominent, its dark oiliness underlined by a generous helping of nutmeg, pimento, and pepper. The toasty tones of Virginia cedar form a bridge between the dusty cistus in the heart to the powdery benzoin in the far dry-down. But, although Mortel is undeniably dry and austere, its dryness is organic, like the natural dustiness of soot or charcoal. Calming and meditative, it is an incense that will elevate the spirit without grinding the wearer down. Believe us, that's a hard balance to strike, and in our opinion, Mortel nails it."," Black pepper, pimento, nutmeg, frankincense, Virginia cedar, cistus, myrrh and benzoin",mortel prof reason incense burn church thousand year smell darn good yes incense use purify air rid place worship bad spirit truth matter scent frankincense labdanum myrrh benzoin almost universally pleasing question become build incense fragrance way stand countless genre use roomfille synthetic lift resin dense airless airy bright almost soapy mortel bonedry monastic take theme differ entry field wearable casual everyday sense supremely natural feel skips entirely limepeel brightness topnote frankincense plunge instead directly towards heart dark waxy smokedout resin vein sizzling black pepper structure stacks churchy resin around core extremely dry labdanum completely lacks friendly caramelic tone usual presentation myrrh licoricelike earthy particularly prominent dark oiliness underline generous help nutmeg pimento pepper toasty tone virginia cedar form bridge dusty cistus heart powdery benzoin far drydown although mortel undeniably dry austere dryness organic like natural dustiness soot charcoal calm meditative incense elevate spirit without grind wearer believe us hard balance strike opinion mortel nail
olim eau de parfum,Cire Trudon," Olim, Latin for once', is supposed to evoke the excess and vanity of the French court under King Louis. And indeed, this is one pompadour of a fragrance, full of glittering powder, resin, golden bergamot, exotic spice, and intimate musks. Breathing this in, one might imagine the powdered wigs and sugary petit fours of Marie Antoinette, as well as the aromatic lavender waters splashed on by courtiers after their evening toilette. It is glittering, bold, and full-figured  an oriental with its corset stays loosened.We begin at the afternoon tea table of the young Queen and her adoring coquettes. A golden bergamot is doused heavily in powdered sugar, turning it from tart to fizzy and sweet: a lemon sherbet in fragrance form. Aromatic herbs in the heart sparkle  dewy lavender and anise, turning the air violet as the gentlemen drench their wigs and clothes to freshen them. But there is something sensual and skin-like underneath the bright elements, a combination of creamy musk, clove, and patchouli giving the lavender and bergamot a naughty Jicky edge. The deliberate clashing of citrus and cream, aromatics and resin, well  that's the classic recipe for when you want to do an oriental right. And Olim gets it right. If you love the warm sexiness of big-boned orientals such as Shalimar, Musc Ravageur, and Opus 1144, then Olim ought to give you a thrill."," bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk",olim latin suppose evoke excess vanity french court king louis indeed one pompadour fragrance full glitter powder resin golden bergamot exotic spice intimate musks breathing one may imagine powder wigs sugary petit four marie antoinette well aromatic lavender water splashed courtier evening toilette glitter bold fullfigure oriental corset stay loosen begin afternoon tea table young queen adore coquette golden bergamot douse heavily powder sugar turn tart fizzy sweet lemon sherbet fragrance form aromatic herbs heart sparkle dewy lavender anise turn air violet gentleman drench wigs clothe freshen something sensual skinlike underneath bright element combination creamy musk clove patchouli give lavender bergamot naughty jicky edge deliberate clash citrus cream aromatics resin well classic recipe want oriental right olim get right love warm sexiness bigbone oriental shalimar musc ravageur opus 1144 olim ought give thrill
revolution eau de parfum,Cire Trudon," Inspired by the chaos in the streets of Paris during the French Revolution, Revolution is a fragrance full of the smells of danger  the peppery smoke of gunpowder mingling with raging fire, leather riding boots, and spilled musket oil. Such accords have the potential to come off as harsh or extreme, but in the experienced hands of British perfumer Lyn Harris, they convey the excitement of battle with a buttery smoothness that makes the scent a breeze to wear. So we have rugged, ashy leather and the sooty smoke from burned-out houses, but with a creamy elemi underpinning that immediately softens the punch. Cade oil muscles its way past the buttery leather, filling the nostrils with its intensely green-black, smoky smell. Adding to the powerful impression of chaos created by the opening, a peppery papyrus combines with dusty cedar to create a searing flash of gunpowder from a newly-spent musket. Together, these notes conjure up the image of a young soldier, taking temporary shelter in a burned-out house on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, the searing smell of soot, ash, singed leather boots, and gunpowder softened by the creamy smell of ancient cedar bookcases, sheaves of paper, and the whiff of incense from a nearby church. And it's this juxtaposition between burned and creamy elements that gives the scent its power to soothe and excite at the same time.  Revolution is the smell of the vestiges of civilization meeting the approaching fires of the crusaders."," elemi, angelica, cedar, papyrus, patchouli, cade, incense, cistus, opoponax",inspire chaos street paris french revolution revolution fragrance full smell danger peppery smoke gunpowder mingle rage fire leather ride boot spill musket oil accord potential come harsh extreme experienced hand british perfumer lyn harris convey excitement battle buttery smoothness make scent breeze wear rugged ashy leather sooty smoke burnedout house creamy elemi underpinning immediately softens punch cade oil muscle way past buttery leather fill nostril intensely greenblack smoky smell add powerful impression chaos create opening peppery papyrus combine dusty cedar create searing flash gunpowder newlyspent musket together note conjure image young soldier take temporary shelter burnedout house champsalysaes searing smell soot ash singe leather boot gunpowder soften creamy smell ancient cedar bookcase sheaf paper whiff incense nearby church juxtaposition burn creamy element give scent power soothe excite time revolution smell vestige civilization meeting approach fire crusaders

woman in gold eau de parfum,By Kilian," The Austrian Mona Lisa glows not with an ambiguous smile, but in gorgeous golden patterns, motifs, and flushed rosy cheeks. Gustav Klimt's 1907 portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is one of the most famous of his erotic gold-leaf paintings. By Kilian's Woman In Gold conjures a similar sensuality and play between light and shadow through a delicate rose as seen through unctuous vanilla and exquisite woods. Woman in Gold glows from the onset, with a tart bergamot and ripe mandarin, blended into soft-focus by a warm vanillic tonka bean. A sweet silken rose slowly blooms, petals lifting, whipped to a velvety froth, but with a darkness within, hinted at by gentle layers of oud and patchouli, seamlessly adjoined. The result is a perfume as complex and dazzling as the woman who wears it."," bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean",austrian mona lisa glow not ambiguous smile gorgeous golden pattern motifs flush rosy cheeks gustav klimts 1907 portrait adele blochbauer one famous erotic goldleaf painting kilians woman gold conjure similar sensuality play light shadow delicate rise see unctuous vanilla exquisite wood woman gold glow onset tart bergamot ripe mandarin blend softfocus warm vanillic tonka bean sweet silken rise slowly blooms petal lift whip velvety froth darkness within hint gentle layer oud patchouli seamlessly adjoin result perfume complex dazzle woman wear

But despite the gourmand connotations, a fresh anisic bite adds an invigorating masculine edge for the Gold Knight - most distinctively paired with a bright, dry bergamot in the opening. As the scent grows darker, the honeyed patchouli shimmers with cinnamon, vanilla, and anise into a warm, sexy powerhouse.A magnificent collector's edition coffret, beautifully embellished in homage to artist Gustav Klimt's unique signature style and masterful use of gold leaf.

eau my soul eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," While the internet can be a nasty, spiteful, ungenerous place (to say the very least), we're delighted to report that fragrance lovers, by and large, are the exact opposite- which explains the success of many supportive, loving private communities of perfume aficionados online, including Christi Long's Eau My Soul. To celebrate this island of positivity, 4160's Sarah McCartney offered EMS's members a rare chance- vote on their top 25 favorite notes, and she would blend them together into a magnum opus of fragrance. Lo and behold, the votes were cast, and Sarah delivered with Eau My Soul, the newest and most democratic of releases from 4160 Tuesdays.Working primarily from sandalwood and amber, the top two vote-getters, Eau My Soul is an exuberant delight, or as Sarah herself describes it, a ""warm, friendly, inclusive group hug"" of a scent. A fresh bust of early citrus quickly warms into smooth, creamy woods and amber, giving off the delectable vibe of sparkling root beer.

pink wood eau de parfum,April Aromatics," Imagine the majestic web of roots beneath the ground's surface - the entwining rhizomatic structure, flowing energy deep from the earth. Tanya Bochnig, the natural perfumer of April Aromatics, has created an ode to these roots with Pink Wood, a regal blend that taps the root extracts and botanicals from plants growing close to the earth.Pink Wood unfurls dramatically with rose, the queen of flowers as Sappho called her, making her grand entrance in grand doses, in the form of rose absolute and rose otto. The rose feels warm and generous, honeyed around the edges with tart, sweet pink fruits and buttressed by a spiced bourbon-like oakwood. A dignified oud partners with the rose, but it's never overwhelming - in fact, a beautifully aged patchouli and radiant sandalwood smooth out all the edges, as cistus and labdanum expand with earthy darkness. Above all else, this is a grounding scent, teaching us that the heart and roots are not so separate after all."," Rose otto, rose absolute, geranium, pink fruits, rosewood, sandalwood, agarwood, patchouli, cistus, labdanum, oak",imagine majestic web root beneath ground surface entwine rhizomatic structure flow energy deep earth tanya bochnig natural perfumer april aromatics create ode root pink wood regal blend tap root extracts botanical plant grow close earth pink wood unfurls dramatically rise queen flower sappho call make grand entrance grand doses form rise absolute rise otto rise feel warm generous honey around edges tart sweet pink fruit buttress spice bourbonlike oakwood dignified oud partner rise never overwhelming fact beautifully aged patchouli radiant sandalwood smooth edges cistus labdanum expand earthy darkness else ground scent teaching us heart root not separate
el cosmico eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," El Cosmico is both a difficult, and an easy, place to explain. On the one hand, it's almost impossible to succinctly describe this campground-turned-venue-turned-hotel-turned-landmark, or the remote, artists'-haven town of Marfa where it resides. On the other hand, when you're sitting around a roaring fire under the West Texas stars, it's simple to pick a single word: magical. This is at the core of David Moltz's El Cosmico, an ode to a truly remarkable place where the rustically timeless and the bleeding edge of hip coexist in beautiful harmony. Originally conceived for a 2015 performance where a proprietary olfactory instrument circulated scents throughout an outdoor crowd while his band performed, Moltz has since synthesized that experience into a single fragrance that perfectly captures the aura of the high plains desert: citric sumac plays against darkly smoky creosote and a zing of mesquite, while robustly fresh pinyon pine and oak lend a woodsy backbone. Above it all floats an enchanting, gently sparkling, and almost ozonic note- perhaps the sand accord?- that perfectly evokes the astounding glow of the stars out far beyond any city lights. Suspended between the luminous cosmos and the rugged frontier, El Cosmico is a delightful, surprising, enchanting new scent from D.S. & Durga."," Sumac, creosote, pinyon pine, oak, mesquite, sand, woods",el cosmico difficult easy place explain one hand almost impossible succinctly describe campgroundturnedvenueturnedhotelturnedlandmark remote artistshaven town marfa reside hand sit around roar fire west texas star simple pick single word magical core david moltzs el cosmico ode truly remarkable place rustically timeless bleed edge hip coexist beautiful harmony originally conceive 2015 performance proprietary olfactory instrument circulate scent throughout outdoor crowd band perform moltz since synthesize experience single fragrance perfectly capture aura high plains desert citric sumac play darkly smoky creosote zing mesquite robustly fresh pinyon pine oak lend woodsy backbone float enchanting gently sparkle almost ozonic note perhaps sand accord perfectly evoke astounding glow star far beyond city light suspend luminous cosmos rugged frontier el cosmico delightful surprising enchanting new scent ds durga

Leaving all his belongings behind, he set off on foot, hopped a freighter across the Indian Ocean, and wandered into the Bangladesh wilderness. His journey, which lasted over a decade, took him through Nepal and Tibet where his exploration turned spiritual and into rural China where months of solitude resulted in some of the most confessional observations ever committed to paper. This is the story of a man grappling with the meaning of life as he grasps to life's last vestiges.At the risk of sounding bleak, this night could be your last. Splash on O, Unknown! and plunge forth - the black tea leaves are swirling with ambiguous meanings, imbued with a light smokiness from Lapsang Souchong.

It's fluffy, almost airy -- but there's a darkness around the edges, discreetly smoldering with patchouli and incense. Once Peru balsam kicks in, it's a veritable amber, but shape-shifting, nonetheless.

cafe tuberosa cologne absolue,Atelier Cologne," Encountering CafÃ© Tuberosa is like entering a bustling coffeeshop, with that dark, bittersweet scent of freshly roasted coffee beans, grinding and pressed for a perfect cup of espresso.  The mouthwatering citrus that Atelier Cologne famously perfected is present in small doses here  just enough Calabrian bergamot to whet the tongue, and a ripe, tangy Sicilian tangerine that adds a wonderful fruity quality to an otherwise deep, warm cacao. In fact, the combination of rich cacao, classic espresso, and cardamom-flecked vanilla puts CafÃ© Tuberosa squarely in the gourmand category. And when Atelier Cologne does gourmand, they do it with subtlety and flair, and the proof is in the pudding. For despite its name, CafÃ© Tuberosa contains no high-powered tuberose, and the florals here are quite relaxed  it's the vanilla espresso combo that keeps us sniffing for more.

my own private teahupo'o eau de parfum,A Lab on Fire," Teahupo'o, on the Tahitian coast- a place of unmatched beauty and untamed nature, where waves that begin as droplets of water in Antarctica gather power over thousands of miles before crashing ashore with such majestic power that the village has become perhaps the holiest- and most dangerous- site in international surfing. To commemorate this uniquely Tahitian fusion of intensity and tranquility, Carlos Kusubayashi enlisted the S-Perfume team to create My Own Private Teahupo'o, an exhilarating, intense oceanic scent with a surprisingly soothing development. Opening with a blast of salty ozone that drops us immediately onto the side of one of Teahupo'o's iconic 20-foot vertical waves, the scent instantly thrums with sensual energy.

Osmanthus is a most bewitching flower, its elegant petals often scenting the rice fields of China with their potently smoky, fruity fragrance. In Suede Osmanthe, the delicate flower's seductive contrasts are deconstructed and magnified to gorgeous effect.The first surprise comes in the fresh, lilting fizz of aldehydes - herbaceously floral and soapy-clean, the bubbles float and tug at the surface of a just-ripened apricot, and the fuzzy skin lets out small whiffs of the sweet fruit within. In a most natural transition, apricot skin melts into soft, cozy suede, and leathery Suederal radiates with the black tea leaves in a smoky embrace. The notes suddenly ring perfectly of a sleek osmanthus, slimmed down to its essentials. The illusion completes itself in a wave of silky musks, androgynous and mysterious. It's a chic illusion, as there's no actual osmanthus here, but as with the most beautiful sleight-of-hand, you'll fall in love anyway."," Aldehydes, black tea, osmanthus, apricot, Suederal, Cashmeran, musks",pierre guillaume rework fragrance bottom leau de circe fruity paeon peachy osmanthus suede osmanthe dark mysterious cousin whose true identity question osmanthus bewitching flower elegant petal often scent rice field china potently smoky fruity fragrance suede osmanthe delicate flower seductive contrast deconstruct magnified gorgeous effect first surprise come fresh lilt fizz aldehyde herbaceously floral soapyclean bubble float tug surface justripene apricot fuzzy skin lets small whiff sweet fruit within natural transition apricot skin melt soft cozy suede leathery suederal radiates black tea leave smoky embrace note suddenly perfectly sleek osmanthus slimme essentials illusion complete wave silky musks androgynous mysterious chic illusion no actual osmanthus beautiful sleightofhand fall love anyway

Patchouli Sublime's appeal is in how the exquisite blend unfolds, starting from its high-altitude crisp beginning. If we were to compare it to its predecessor, Patchouli Intense, we would call them cousins  one of the earth, one of the sky.  Minty and green, a fresh lavender sets a classic stage for Patchouli Sublime, sparkling from its mountaintop.

The elephants fulfill a vital role- purging the delicate ecosystem, allowing new life to flourish.From beneath a canopy of lush, damp foliage, the complex aromas of Zoologist Elephant emerge. Into a mixture of invigorating Darjeeling and incense, swirl hints of magnolia, coconut and cocoa.

layton exclusif eau de parfum,Parfums de Marly," When we first heard that Parfums de Marly had a new version of their cult favorite Layton, we admit we were at a bit of a loss: how could they possibly improve on the fruity, spicy, gloriously lively luxuriousness of this ode to the splendor of Versailles? Now that we have it in our hands, we're pleased to announce this is no mere flanker. Instead, perhaps inspired by Marie Antoinette's extensive remodeling of the palace and grounds in the 18th century, Marly has rebuilt Layton from the ground up, delivering a companion piece to the fresh, sporty original that surrounds the signature blend of fruits and spices with deep, animalic woods and resins for a darkly seductive experience. In Layton Exclusif, a heavy dose of civet hums through the rich floral heart, delivering a new layer of sensuality. And the already opulent vanilla and woods base is further enhanced, with resinous amber and an alluringly powerful coffee note to invigorate the senses and heighten the passion. Does Layton Exclusif take the place of our beloved Layton? It's not meant to. Instead, we think of the two as the ultimate pair- Layton, a gentleman's perfect match for a day of royal festivities, and Layton Exclusif, a dangerously seductive secret weapon when day turns to evening."," Bergamot, mandarin, water accord, grapefruit, rose, geranium, waterlily, gardenia, civet, cardamom, sandalwood, gaiac, amber, pink pepper, vanilla, coffee, musk",first hear parfum de marly new version cult favorite layton admit bit loss could possibly improve fruity spicy gloriously lively luxuriousness ode splendor versailles hand pleased announce no mere flanker instead perhaps inspire marie antoinette extensive remodeling palace ground 18th century marly rebuilt layton ground deliver companion piece fresh sporty original surround signature blend fruit spice deep animalic wood resin darkly seductive experience layton exclusif heavy dose civet hum rich floral heart deliver new layer sensuality already opulent vanilla wood base enhance resinous amber alluringly powerful coffee note invigorate sense heighten passion layton exclusif take place beloved layton not mean instead think two ultimate pair layton gentlemans perfect match day royal festivity layton exclusif dangerously seductive secret weapon day turn evening
oud wood intense eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," In celebration of the 10th anniversary of Oud Wood, a game-changer in its use of oud for Western perfumery, Tom Ford has come out with a confident, commanding new take with Oud Wood Intense. If you're expecting the same old song but with a different tune, you'll be pleasantly, outrageously surprised  it's no flanker here. Indeed, with the higher extrait concentration, the amped-up rugged texture is entirely its own doing, with a fresh new set of notes.Don't undermine that word Intense  the supercharged fragrance opens with a zingy, hydrating burst of aromatics and spices with the addition of piquant cypress, juniper, and angelica root. They combine for an almost citrus-like sweet fresh energy, but always with a slightly bitter, verdant edge. Then, at the heart of Oud Wood Intense, we reach the growling, meaty heart. Layers of ginger add spice while Tom Ford's signature smooth oud sings, but don't be fooled  this is the most prominently smoky, textured oud of his yet.

baccarat rouge 540 extrait extrait de parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," In the Fall of 2014, Baccarat, the most prestigious and opulent crystalworks in the world, celebrated the 250th anniversary of their founding by releasing an extraordinary crystal decanter containing a luminous, exclusive fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian. Released later onto the open market in a slightly more achievable presentation as Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP, the world quickly fell in love with the gorgeously woody floral-amber and its equal parts transparent, dense, and intense character. Now, Baccarat and M. Kurkdjian extend their partnership with a new Extrait concentration that intensifies the power and radiance of all aspects of the scent, all without betraying the original inspiration.MFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The ""breeze"" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling ""heat"" accord. Finally, a ""mineral"" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

histoire d'orangers eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," This newest offering from L'Artisan Parfumeur is a radiant tribute to the perfumer Marie Salagmagne's travels in the valley of Souss, at the foothills of the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. Remembering the sunset atop the earth walls of the Taroudant, the warm light intensifying the colors of the raw land, she remarks,Each time I think of this majestic landscape, I think of orange tree flower water. A delicate and delicious water, ultra-refreshing and incredibly luminous.Histoires D'Orangers is truly a story of oranges sublimated into a most delicate and pure flower water. From its sparkling white tea and verdant neroli beginning, to the gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed in glistening mineral ambroxan, it is a gentle, exquisite fragrance, through and through. There's much to revel in, when the subtleties are revealed - whether it's the musk that achieves a triple-milled purity that's never overtly soapy, or the light almond-like hint of tonka beans  the end result is like a feeling more than anything  like silk on skin, warmed by the sun."," Neroli, orange blossom, white tea, musk, tonka bean, ambroxan",new offering lartisan parfumeur radiant tribute perfumer marie salagmagne travel valley souss foothills antiatlas morocco remember sunset atop earth wall taroudant warm light intensify color raw land remarkseach time think majestic landscape think orange tree flower water delicate delicious water ultrarefreshing incredibly luminous histoire doranger truly story orange sublimate delicate pure flower water sparkle white tea verdant neroli begin gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed glistening mineral ambroxan gentle exquisite fragrance much revel subtlety reveal whether musk achieve triplemille purity never overtly soapy light almondlike hint tonka bean end result like feel anything like silk skin warm sun

the cora eau de parfum,Thameen," The Cora Sun-Drop Diamond, discovered in 2010 in South Africa, is the largest yellow pear-shaped diamond in the world, weighing in at an astounding 110.3 carats. Distinguished by its gorgeously vivid yellow hue, the result of nitrogen trapped in the carbon molecules while it was forming billions of years ago, the diamond sold to an anonymous bidder for almost $11 million. While the otherworldly beauty of the Cora Sun-Drop is sadly no longer for sale, Thameen has given us the next best thing, a stunning floral amber that radiates both bright excitement and luxurious elegance. The Cora opens with a sparkling flash of white jasmine and magnolia, shining against sweet wisteria and luscious yellow Bulgarian rose. Like the perfectly cut edge of a worthy stone, a precisely applied dash of nutmeg contrasts with a generous swoon of carnation and lily and a rich ribbon of creamy vanilla that swirls with resinous notes to make a delectable amber.

mandala eau de parfum,Masque Milano," Mandala is an old Sanskrit word for circle that, in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism, has come to mean a feeling of completeness. When Tibetan monks make a mandala offering, they are offering up the universe in a microcosm to Buddha. Thus it follows that Mandala, the fragrance, offers up the gift of every precious material that monks possess to the Gods  frankincense, myrrh, ambergris, and precious spices. The scent opens with the dark, coca cola effervescence of ebony woods, frankincense, and myrrh, immediately flooding the soul with a sense of reverence and peace. At once exotic and atmospheric, one can almost feel cool stone at one's back and hear the low chant of the monks. But despite the rich density of resin and spice, the scent feels weightless and airy. The peppery incense floats over a cool, soapy canopy of cardamom and angelica, which parts to reveal not a church ceiling but the open night sky. A trace of saline moss and ambergris in the base steadies the resins and spices, fixing them in a verdant earthiness that feels solid, grounded. Mandala is Eastern Zen in a bottle."," Nutmeg, angelica, olibanum (frankincense), cardamom, cinnamon, clove, labdanum, cedar, myrrh, sandalwood, oakmoss, ambergris",mandala old sanskrit word circle hinduism tibetan buddhism come mean feel completeness tibetan monk make mandala offering offering universe microcosm buddha thus follow mandala fragrance offer gift every precious material monk possess god frankincense myrrh ambergris precious spice scent open dark coca cola effervescence ebony wood frankincense myrrh immediately flooding soul sense reverence peace exotic atmospheric one almost feel cool stone one back hear low chant monk despite rich density resin spice scent feel weightless airy peppery incense float cool soapy canopy cardamom angelica part reveal not church ceiling open night sky trace saline moss ambergris base steady resin spice fix verdant earthiness feel solid ground mandala eastern zen bottle

nuit de bakelite eau de parfum,Naomi Goodsir," Alluring. That's the simplest way to describe Naomi Goodsir's latest masterpiece, Nuit de Bakelite, an otherworldly, intensely green interpretation of tuberose that's anything but simple. Drawing upon tuberose's most narcotic facets, perfumer Isabelle Doyen has crafted a stunningly bright, tantalizingly aromatic scent that ignites the senses and redefines what a floral fragrance can be. Nuit de Bakelite wastes no time announcing itself, as the very first sniff explodes with a nose-tingling burst of herbaceous angelica and bitter-green galbanum, softened with the earthy smoothness of violet leaf and an exquisite orris that recalls Naomi's equally wonderful Iris Cendre. This spiky-yet-soft dynamic is the perfect showcase for the rich tuberose heart- in Doyen's hands; the ""queen of the night"" is rich, lush and spicy, evoking a visceral carnality but never tilting too far into heavy, indolic territory. As it dries, a chorus of resinous notes and spiced tobacco draw out a vibrant portrait of floral leather, sensuous and still thrillingly green. We've always known that tuberose was among the most spectacular notes in perfumery, but even we had no idea just how beautifully original it still can seem-- until we experienced Nuit de Bakelite.

suede de suede eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," A soft and supple suede scent that caresses the senses. Inspired by in-house perfumer Fredrik Dalman's memories of Sweden, this is a rich, but gentle, blend of wood, leather and musk, with delicate grace notes of flowers and berries. Dalman's vision began with a pair of gloves  suede worn to the point of silkiness, lined with fur  but this scent also reminds us of a fluffy eiderdown comforter on a winter night, providing perfect warmth without heaviness. The musk at the heart of this scent is the ideal balance of clean and sensuous  with the delicate sweetness of osmanthus highlighting the innocent aspects and deep cedarwood and earthy patchouli amplifying the less-innocent ones. Although cloudberry sounds like something that might grow on a magical island, it is a real fruit that grows in Scandinavia  an amber berry with a distinctive tart taste  and it provides an exquisite, cool airiness that counters the warm and creamy suede. Initially sultry, SuÃ¨de de SuÃ¨de softens to become deliciously cozy and inviting."," Cloudberry, Sichuan pepper, suede accord, cedarwood, osmanthus, strawberry leaf, castoreum, patchouli, precious musks",soft supple suede scent caress sense inspire inhouse perfumer fredrik dalmans memories sweden rich gentle blend wood leather musk delicate grace note flower berry dalmans vision begin pair glove suede wear point silkiness line fur scent also remind us fluffy eiderdown comforter winter night provide perfect warmth without heaviness musk heart scent ideal balance clean sensuous delicate sweetness osmanthus highlight innocent aspect deep cedarwood earthy patchouli amplify lessinnocent one although cloudberry sound like something may grow magical island real fruit grow scandinavia amber berry distinctive tart taste provide exquisite cool airiness counter warm creamy suede initially sultry sua de de sua de softens become deliciously cozy invite
dojima eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," DÃµjima opens with a delicious almond-like sweetness, which is intriguingly countered by a crisp and aromatic clary sage, setting the stage for a truly unusual scent. Tranquil and unique, DÃµjima is named for the Dojima Rice Exchange founded by Samurai in 1697, in Osaka, Japan and is a meditation on the perfect beauty of a grain of rice. A rice accord gives this fragrance its intriguing, hard-to- place quality  the subtle, milky warmth of steamed white rice is an undercurrent to a soothing cloud of rice powder laced with jasmine and orris. The deep sweetness of amber with a dash of nutmeg provides a rich and mellow base. An unexpected blend of edible and powdery notes that is both mysterious and comforting.

Inspired by a visit to a top Italian chocolatier, Sammarco takes the richest black chocolate cake, slathers it in thick layers over a spicy, earthy, and woody patchouli, and then elevates everything to the next level by adding cognac liqueur, sweet plummy fruits, smoky tobacco, smooth leather, and a touch of expresso.

naias extrait de parfum,Sammarco," Sammarco plays once more with classical and modern perfume styles in this beautifully original, playful fruity floral that caught our attention from the very first sniff with a bright, explosively tart, lip-smacking green apple note. It's lightly sweetened with pear juice and neroli, then poured over jammy red roses, violets, green violet leaf, and a vintage-style accord of lightly powdered iris and lipstick-smelling orris. The vintage elements slowly give way to a very modern darkness, thanks to smoky osmanthus leather that's been coated in amber resins, layered with buttery sandalwood, and licked by a touch of animalic muskiness. As it develops further, Naias turns into a chameleon, its soft notes weaving and dancing in the air, frequently changing, sometimes rippling out as a fruity floral leather, sometimes as a creamy irisy woody musk with amber, abstract flowers, tangy fruits, and powder woven in. It eventually finishes as a cashmere soft mix of caramel-scented amber, plush woods, and powdered sweetness. We love Naias for its seamless layering of contrasting elements and its effortless mix of genres-- but it's also a lot of fun and easy to wear-- we bet you'll enjoy Naias as much as we do!"," Violet, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, neroli, iris, sandalwood, apple, pear, cassis, mandarin, amber",sammarco play classical modern perfume style beautifully original playful fruity floral catch attention first sniff bright explosively tart lipsmacking green apple note lightly sweeten pear juice neroli pour jammy red rose violet green violet leaf vintagestyle accord lightly powder iris lipsticksmelle orris vintage element slowly give way modern darkness thanks smoky osmanthus leather coat amber resin layered buttery sandalwood lick touch animalic muskiness develop naias turn chameleon soft note weaving dance air frequently change sometimes ripple fruity floral leather sometimes creamy irisy woody musk amber abstract flower tangy fruit powder weave eventually finish cashmere soft mix caramelscented amber plush wood powder sweetness love naias seamless layer contrast element effortless mix genre also lot fun easy wear bet enjoy naias much
osmanthus eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Osmanthus is beautiful 365 days a year. But there's no denying that it really comes into its own in the summer heat, when it wears like the crispest white linen summer dress you've ever had the pleasure of putting on. Opening with a lively duo of bitter, greenish citrus and artemisia, the fragrance immediately establishes itself as a very clean, peppery, and invigorating citrusy floral. The osmanthus is there, half-hidden in the rustle of green muguet and leaves, but it is not overly ripe or fruity, instead emitting only delicate wisps of leathery apricot skin. The gently bitter citrus and herbs carry through to the heart, where the osmanthus melts into a radiant white jasmine, creating a gauzy, diaphanous floral effect akin to a flurry of moist petals settling on the surface of green water. And although the base gives us a bit of ambery woods for structure, the overall feel here is of a lively, cheerful floral brimming with pepper and citrus. But don't mistake freshness for banality! As flinty and delicious as a glass of chilled Sancerre, Osmanthus shows us just how intoxicating crisp, clean flowers can be when handled by the right hands."," Pomelo, artemisia, red pepper, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine sambac, cedar, labdanum resin, vetiver, musk",osmanthus beautiful 365 day year no deny really come summer heat wear like crisp white linen summer dress ever pleasure put opening lively duo bitter greenish citrus artemisia fragrance immediately establishes clean peppery invigorate citrusy floral osmanthus halfhidden rustle green muguet leave not overly ripe fruity instead emit delicate wisps leathery apricot skin gently bitter citrus herbs carry heart osmanthus melt radiant white jasmine create gauzy diaphanous floral effect akin flurry moist petal settle surface green water although base give us bit ambery wood structure overall feel lively cheerful floral brim pepper citrus not mistake freshness banality flinty delicious glass chill sancerre osmanthus show us intoxicate crisp clean flower handle right hand
ta'if eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ta'if roses have to hustle to survive in a hostile growing environment, high up on the plains of a rocky region near Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Mirroring its harsh environment, the Ta'if rose yields oil that is almost as extreme in its biting greenness and peppery spiciness. To complement its obstinate and proud character, Linda Pilkington chose to surround the rose with an array of exciting Arabianflavors, such as saffron and dates - the saffron adding a mysterious, iodine-like touch of leather, the dates adding a juicy sweetness that gives the texture a satisfying, toffee-like chew. Ta'if is simply breathtaking. At first sharp and spicy with pepper, the rose note soon emerges in all its pushy, exotic beauty, like a Ta'if rose itself erupting through the rocky, arid soil of the Mecca plains. Later dusted heavily with bitter saffron and softened with a soapy freesia, the rose relaxes into a comfortable, peachy tone that is as unexpected as it is joyful. Orange blossom and dates add a fudgy sweetness that nudges the rose towards a Persian sweetmeat, giving the fragrance a jellied lokhoum feel. Ta'if is never thick or leaden in its exotic sweetness, however, because little wafts of gorse bush-like broom cut through the ambered heft of the base to provide lift and air. A pleasure to wear and smell, Ta'if is a gust of authentic desert air, full of spicy rose, orange blossom, and honeyed Arabian treats. Try it and be transported to another world."," Saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber",taif rose hustle survive hostile grow environment high plains rocky region near mecca saudi arabia mirror harsh environment taif rise yield oil almost extreme bite greenness peppery spiciness complement obstinate proud character linda pilkington choose surround rise array exciting arabianflavor saffron date saffron add mysterious iodinelike touch leather date add juicy sweetness give texture satisfy toffeelike chew taif simply breathtake first sharp spicy pepper rise note soon emerge pushy exotic beauty like taif rise erupt rocky arid soil mecca plains later dust heavily bitter saffron soften soapy freesia rise relax comfortable peachy tone unexpected joyful orange blossom date add fudgy sweetness nudges rise towards persian sweetmeat give fragrance jellied lokhoum feel taif never thick leaden exotic sweetness however little wafts gorse bushlike broom cut ambere heft base provide lift air pleasure wear smell taif gust authentic desert air full spicy rise orange blossom honey arabian treats try transport another world
tolu eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Tolu is that rare animal in perfumery: an oriental that won't have you gasping for air or reaching for an insulin pen. The reason it succeeds  and succeeds so gloriously  is because of its confident balance between the warmly resinous and the briskly herbal. Fresh, green clary sage and juniper berry infuse the creamy-sweet amber with gusts of air straight from the deepest pine forest. Orange blossom adds a thickly honeyed feel to the resin, but this is balanced immediately by a crisp muguet that illuminates everything with its cool, watery greenness. Tart frankincense and roses weave through the creamy, chocolatey tonka bean foundation, aerating it and making it a treat that satisfies completely but will never weigh you down.    It would be remiss of us not to mention Tolu's incredible versatility. Its plush, velvety depth make it perfectly suited to a night out in Paris or the opera; but its sunny warmth also lends itself most affably to snuggling with a loved one, or taking a long walk on cool Fall days, kicking over the amber-colored leaves. Tolu is the type of fragrance whose delicious-but-not-filling sweetness invites you to bury your nose in your coat collars and scarves to sniff out its lingering trail of gorgeousness."," Juniper berry, orange blossom, clary sage, orchid, Moroccan rose, muguet (lily of the valley), tolu balsam, tonka bean, golden frankincense, amber",tolu rare animal perfumery oriental not gasping air reach insulin pen reason succeed succeed gloriously confident balance warmly resinous briskly herbal fresh green clary sage juniper berry infuse creamysweet amber gust air straight deep pine forest orange blossom add thickly honey feel resin balance immediately crisp muguet illuminate everything cool watery greenness tart frankincense rose weave creamy chocolatey tonka bean foundation aerate make treat satisfie completely never weigh would remiss us not mention tolus incredible versatility plush velvety depth make perfectly suited night paris opera sunny warmth also lend affably snuggle love one take long walk cool fall day kick ambercolore leave tolu type fragrance whose deliciousbutnotfille sweetness invites bury nose coat collar scarf sniff linger trail gorgeousness
montabaco - parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Inspired by the rugged exoticism of the Argentinean plains, Montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3D picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. All this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with Iso E Super and Hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.A fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air. Although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, Montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. But the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. The result? A genuinely masculineGaucho type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the Argentinean outback. The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," Air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",inspire rugged exoticism argentinean plains montabaco tower crescendo rich tobacco leather tea suede wood note nuance overlap last almost 3d picture cowboy appear smoking cigarette dwindle fire long hard day corral cattle top bed airy floral puffed iso e super hedione bright silverywoody radiance perfectly equipped carry heft leather shoulder fresh balmy clary sage note dominate first like nosegay fresh green herbs tucked flap saddle give fragrance attractively livedin air although radiant floral certainly perform role montabaco not really floral fragrance tough smoky wood moss leather accord dominate fresh dance lightness tea leaf white jasmine infuse scent enough air space heavier note breathe result genuinely masculinegaucho type fragrance pitch halfway grimy wellworn leather experience smoky herbal airiness argentinean outback fragrance four corner collection available pure parfum intensivo concentration intensivo strong two format

Although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, Montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. But the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. The result? A genuinely masculineGaucho type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the Argentinean outback. The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," Air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",inspire rugged exoticism argentinean plains montabaco tower crescendo rich tobacco leather tea suede wood note nuance overlap last almost 3d picture cowboy appear smoking cigarette dwindle fire long hard day corral cattle top bed airy floral puffed iso e super hedione bright silverywoody radiance perfectly equipped carry heft leather shoulder fresh balmy clary sage note dominate first like nosegay fresh green herbs tucked flap saddle give fragrance attractively livedin air although radiant floral certainly perform role montabaco not really floral fragrance tough smoky wood moss leather accord dominate fresh dance lightness tea leaf white jasmine infuse scent enough air space heavier note breathe result genuinely masculinegaucho type fragrance pitch halfway grimy wellworn leather experience smoky herbal airiness argentinean outback fragrance four corner collection available pure parfum intensivo concentration intensivo strong two format
nawab of oudh - intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," Nawab of Oudh is, essentially, the spirit of a traditional Indian attar wrapped up in the format of a Western spray fragrance. Think a mass of jammy rose petals, fermented magnolia blossoms, and pandan leaf over a warm, spicy amber mercifully free of any vanilla that might weigh it down. The traditional Indian attar tends towards the lean and spicy rather than sweet or fatty, and this is a style carried through very faithfully to Nawab of Oudh.    For those afraid of oud, don't worry  in Nawab of Oudh, the oud note is there only to gild the other accords with a hint of something animalic, in much the same way as civet was used in classic French perfumery. The main body of this beautiful, majestic fragrance is that warm, salt leather amber wrapped around intensely fragrant rose petals, orange peel, and magnolia, with just a hint of the nobly-rotting wood of oud peeking through the slats every now and then. Richly braided and embroidered in the Indian tradition, Nawab of Oudh will make you feel like, well, a Nawab."," Green notes, bergamot, orange absolute, cardamom, aldehyde, rose, magnolia, orchid, pimento, bay, cinnamon, hedione, ambergris, musk, vetiver, labdanum, oudh",nawab oudh essentially spirit traditional indian attar wrap format western spray fragrance think mass jammy rise petal ferment magnolia blossom pandan leaf warm spicy amber mercifully free vanilla may weigh traditional indian attar tend towards lean spicy rather sweet fatty style carry faithfully nawab oudh afraid oud not worry nawab oudh oud note gild accord hint something animalic much way civet use classic french perfumery main body beautiful majestic fragrance warm salt leather amber wrap around intensely fragrant rise petal orange peel magnolia hint noblyrotte wood oud peek slats every richly braid embroider indian tradition nawab oudh make feel like well nawab
qi - intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," Inspired by the Chinese symbol Qi (pronouncedChi), meaning breath of life', Ormonde Jayne's QI is a tribute to the aesthetic taste for delicacy that permeates Chinese culture from top to toe. Never intended to be a showy or dramatic fragrance, Qi instead reads as a light breeze carried from a cultivated Japanese garden, warmed through with hints of clean, tea-like florals and silky osmanthus petals. Qi opens with the balmy bite of neroli and lemon blossom, a delicately fresh precursor to a heart full of osmanthus, which laces the scent with a juicy, apricot-like aroma as well as the lightly tannic scent of green tea leaves. For a while, the scent floats peacefully along in this faintly peppered and fruited tea vein until a soft, mossy musk blurs the edges of the scent. Traversing all the minute stops between a fruity osmanthus oolong to a dry, green matÃ©, Qi is simply a must try for tea lovers, or indeed for anyone who values translucence and refinement above all.The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," Green lemon blossom, neroli, freesia, tea notes, osmanthus, violet, hedione, rose, mate, benzoin, musk, moss, myrrh",inspire chinese symbol qi pronouncedchi meaning breath life ormonde jaynes qi tribute aesthetic taste delicacy permeate chinese culture top toe never intend showy dramatic fragrance qi instead reads light breeze carry cultivate japanese garden warm hint clean tealike floral silky osmanthus petal qi open balmy bite neroli lemon blossom delicately fresh precursor heart full osmanthus lace scent juicy apricotlike aroma well lightly tannic scent green tea leave scent float peacefully along faintly peppered fruit tea vein soft mossy musk blurs edges scent traverse minute stop fruity osmanthus oolong dry green mata qi simply must try tea lover indeed anyone value translucence refinement fragrance four corner collection available pure parfum intensivo concentration intensivo strong two format
ambre royal eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ambre Royal is a resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer is amplified in the base by the hot, salty rasp of ambergris. To wear it is to feel dipped in liquid gold and then rolled in fleurs de sel, the floral salt winnowed from the marshes of Brittany. Sappy green herbs and juicy orange announce the house signature, their peppery brightness sending a shaft of light through the structure, cheerfully prepping the way for the resins and flowers that follow. Behind the sparkle of the opening act, the soft creaminess of flowers beckons - a heart full of rosy, creamy orchid and the delicately leathery apricot of Chinese osmanthus. But caressed constantly by sweet, resinous amber and that woody-salty ambergris, the vibe is never overtly floral. The flowers exist mainly to fleck the molten red-gold warmth of the amber with little daubs of watery, dewy freshness, and ensure that the structure retains its luminous weightlessness. In the base, a duo of earthy, chocolatey patchouli and sweet, creamy tonka provide a dark contrast to the shimmering brightness of the top. A sophisticated, and yes, regal amber, it is the salty floral breeze running through Ambre Royal that positions it far away from the rough and tumble of the souk."," Green notes, orange absolute, bergamot, jasmine, orchid, osmanthus, rose, amber, orris, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",ambre royal resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer amplify base hot salty rasp ambergris wear feel dip liquid gold roll fleur de sel floral salt winnow marshes brittany sappy green herbs juicy orange announce house signature peppery brightness send shaft light structure cheerfully preppe way resin flower follow behind sparkle opening act soft creaminess flower beckon heart full rosy creamy orchid delicately leathery apricot chinese osmanthus caress constantly sweet resinous amber woodysalty ambergris vibe never overtly floral flower exist mainly fleck molten redgold warmth amber little daub watery dewy freshness ensure structure retain luminous weightlessness base duo earthy chocolatey patchouli sweet creamy tonka provide dark contrast shimmering brightness top sophisticated yes regal amber salty floral breeze run ambre royal position far away rough tumble souk
champaca eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Centered on a green tea accord with a squeeze of zesty lemon, Champaca is as squeaky clean as a freshly-scrubbed face. It is especially good in hot weather, when the papery coolness of the neroli, bamboo, and green tea steps forward to soothe ruffled tempers and restore internal peace. Stirred into this frosty glass of ice tea is a scant teaspoon's worth of basmati rice: subtle but present, it provides just enough cloudy milkiness to take the sting out of the green tea.Champaca is unusual in that it's a floral fragrance that doesn't smell too much of flowers, let alone the titular one. There is a hint of peppery freesia, but it comes across more as clean linen than a flower. Likewise, there is a lot of waxy, yellow champaca blossom here, but only really perceptible as a burst of something lemony and creamy, like magnolia with an undertow of dusky honey. The flowers simply melt into the basmati rice accord to form a subtly peppery creaminess that relieves the sharp, tannic twang of the green tea and citruses. There is something ineffably charming about Champaca  it is rather hard to pin down, but its pearlized, milky freshness gives it all the delicacy of the inside of a conch shell. As sensual as clean skin, we highly recommend Champaca as a soft, slightly milky floral oriental that will enchant in even the hottest of weather."," Neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea",center green tea accord squeeze zesty lemon champaca squeaky clean freshlyscrubbe face especially good hot weather papery coolness neroli bamboo green tea step forward soothe ruffle temper restore internal peace stir frosty glass ice tea scant teaspoon worth basmati rice subtle present provide enough cloudy milkiness take ste green tea champaca unusual floral fragrance not smell much flower let alone titular one hint peppery freesia come across clean linen flower likewise lot waxy yellow champaca blossom really perceptible burst something lemony creamy like magnolia undertow dusky honey flower simply melt basmati rice accord form subtly peppery creaminess relief sharp tannic twang green tea citruses something ineffably charming champaca rather hard pin pearlize milky freshness give delicacy inside conch shell sensual clean skin highly recommend champaca soft slightly milky floral oriental enchant even hot weather
frangipani eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Frangipani is testament to Linda Pilkington's exquisite taste, because instead of the cream-sodden tropicalia you might be expecting based on the name, Frangipani filters the brightly gaudy flower through a very European sensibility. In other words, no sun umbrellas or leis here. The scent itself opens with a bright squeeze of lime, before quickly sliding into a very true-to-life linden blossom, whose aroma of honey, creamed rice, and green powder forms a logical bridge to the central character of the show - the frangipani. The frangipani note here is so wonderful that it's been allowed to shine unfettered by too many other notes. The flower itself has a gently milky, nutty tiarÃ©-like scent that later tips over into the full-fat, salted butter of tuberose. But in its first blush, the frangipani displays a rosy peach facet that moistens the heart and gives it a gentle fruitiness. When the frangipani melts into the magnolia, plum, and orchid notes, it forms a blurred, chocolatey floralcy that feels as soft and inviting as the fuzz on a baby's cheek. A resinous, woody base keep the creaminess of the florals in check, ensuring that while Frangipani retains its balmy and exotic character, it never crosses the line into loudness. A beautiful scent for those who want to dip a tentative toe into tropical waters."," Linden blossom, magnolia, lime, frangipani, rose, tuberose, water lily, plum, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",frangipani testament linda pilkington exquisite taste instead creamsodden tropicalia may expect base name frangipani filter brightly gaudy flower european sensibility word no sun umbrellas leis scent open bright squeeze lime quickly slide truetolife linden blossom whose aroma honey cream rice green powder form logical bridge central character show frangipani frangipani note wonderful allow shine unfettered many note flower gently milky nutty tiaralike scent later tip fullfat salt butter tuberose first blush frangipani display rosy peach facet moisten heart give gentle fruitiness frangipani melt magnolia plum orchid note form blur chocolatey floralcy feel soft invite fuzz babys cheek resinous woody base keep creaminess floral check ensure frangipani retain balmy exotic character never crosse line loudness beautiful scent want dip tentative toe tropical water
isfarkand eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand is a mysterious thing. Its structure is simple and relatively linear  peppery citruses over grassy vetiver and radiant woods  but it transmits such a laid-back, uncluttered appeal that you'll find yourself wondering if there's more to it than meets the eye. Ormonde Jayne's signature opening notes of pink pepper and citrus burn even brighter than normal here, giving the scent the exciting zestiness of a freshly-peeled lime. The peppery spice hugs the toasty cedar and vetiver tightly, the result being a close-knit mÃ©lange of clean woods, citrus, grass, and spice that is so pleasurable to wear that it doesn't really make sense to try and pick it apart.Isfarkand is as easy to wear as a favorite shirt, so don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for it, again and again, even over fragrances that you think you like better. It sounds simple - and it is - but somehow a certain Ormonde Jayne magic ties it all together, making it one of the classiest and most versatile everyday options for the modern man. As a subtle, my-skin-but-better woody vetiver for all seasons, Isfarkand is hard to beat."," Lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss",isfarkand mysterious thing structure simple relatively linear peppery citruses grassy vetiver radiant wood transmit laidback uncluttered appeal find wonder meet eye ormonde jaynes signature opening note pink pepper citrus burn even bright normal give scent exciting zestiness freshlypeele lime peppery spice hug toasty cedar vetiver tightly result closeknit malange clean wood citrus grass spice pleasurable wear not really make sense try pick apart isfarkand easy wear favorite shirt not surprised find reach even fragrance think like well sound simple somehow certain ormonde jayne magic tie together make one classy versatile everyday option modern man subtle myskinbutbetter woody vetiver season isfarkand hard beat
ormonde man eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ormonde Jayne Man takes the bracing coniferous freshness of Ormonde Jayne Woman, and spins it in a slightly different direction, peppering the topnotes with a sparkling lemon and juniper pairing, and giving the basic structure a drier, cleaner feel, with plenty of cedar and agarwood in the drydown for muscle. Juniper, coriander, and a clever use of cardamom up front give the opening a turbo-blast of luridly green, almost fruity spice that propels the scent forwards, as if tied to a jetpack. Although different in feel and texture to Ormonde Jayne Woman, Ormonde Man retains all of its sister scent's mysterious, witchy atmosphere. Imagine losing your way in a thick pine forest in winter; it is dark and cold, but oddly, you feel at complete peace. All around you, the trees exhale their sweet essence of conifer and pine sap, and you breathe it in gladly, knowing that it is both cleansing and nourishing. The oud wood is dry and medicinal, but merged with the sandalwood, cedar, spice, and musk, it becomes less spice route and more traditional Chinese health potion. The drydown is a sheer wash of pinewood and pepper, a watercolor print of the powerful first half that nonetheless works as the perfect fragrance for a gentleman who favors class over volume."," Juniper berry, bergamot, pink pepper, cardamom, coriander, agarwood, black hemlock, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, musk",ormonde jayne man take brace coniferous freshness ormonde jayne woman spin slightly different direction peppering topnote sparkle lemon juniper pair give basic structure drier clean feel plenty cedar agarwood drydown muscle juniper coriander clever use cardamom front give opening turboblast luridly green almost fruity spice propel scent forwards tie jetpack although different feel texture ormonde jayne woman ormonde man retain sister scent mysterious witchy atmosphere imagine lose way thick pine forest winter dark cold oddly feel complete peace around tree exhale sweet essence conifer pine sap breathe gladly know cleanse nourish oud wood dry medicinal merge sandalwood cedar spice musk become less spice route traditional chinese health potion drydown sheer wash pinewood pepper watercolor print powerful first half nonetheless work perfect fragrance gentleman favor class volume
ormonde woman eau de parfum,Ormonde Jayne," Ormonde Jayne Woman is one of those fragrances that are almost impossible to describe using the listed notes, because it only makes sense when explained as an atmosphere or a feeling. For example, we might be able to tell you that this scent contains cardamom, coriander, and the witchy-sounding black hemlock, but we're at a loss as to explain how or why the sum of this simple list of materials is a whole forest from The Brothers Grimm, complete with Hansel and Gretel, and Baba Yaga waiting in her smoky gingerbread house. And yet, it truly is.First, a forest's worth of pungent green herbs and grasses is unfurled beneath your feet, the dark shadows of poison ivy and European oaks swallowing up all the natural daylight at the edges. This velveteen, viridian carpet is dotted with moist, sweet little violets and jasmine petals, their frilly innocence incongruous against the sinister background of forest woods. Ormonde Jayne Woman is a deeply coniferous scent with a fair amount of bitterness, but what really tugs at the heartstrings is its errant thread of sweetness - that smoky, spicy amber note that weaves through the perfume like a siren call to tempt children and adults alike. One of the rare perfumes that truly deserves its reputation asmysterious, we defy you to wear this and not be shaken and stirred."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood",ormonde jayne woman one fragrance almost impossible describe use list note make sense explain atmosphere feel example may able tell scent contain cardamom coriander witchysounde black hemlock loss explain sum simple list material whole forest brother grimm complete hansel gretel baba yaga wait smoky gingerbread house yet truly first forest worth pungent green herbs grass unfurled beneath foot dark shadow poison ivy european oak swallow natural daylight edges velveteen viridian carpet dotted moist sweet little violet jasmine petal frilly innocence incongruous sinister background forest wood ormonde jayne woman deeply coniferous scent fair amount bitterness really tug heartstring errant thread sweetness smoky spicy amber note weave perfume like siren call tempt child adult alike one rare perfumes truly deserve reputation asmysterious defy wear not shake stir
santo incienso extrait de parfum,The Different Company," Originally released as Le15,  a one-time limited offering to celebrate The Different Company's 15-year anniversary of distinguished creations,  Santo Incensio  Sillage SacrÃ© is exactly the same formulation released under a new name for a new life. Described asA sacred perfume that draws its secret from shamanic stances,  like a prayer to the sky,  it showcases the supreme holy wood rarely used in perfumery,  palo santo.The opening spark is a bright flame,  both tart and smoky,  invoking the beginning of ritual. Fizzy orbs of bergamot and petitgrain crackle with delicate shavings of nutmeg,  fragrant and spicy. At the same time,  a vetiver-infused plume of smoke rises,  and palo santo makes its entrance. This is the sacred wood elevated to high chic,  a far cry from rustic bundles of wood - more like a glowing,  elegant veil with meditative grounding. Here,  the enchanting,  contradictory facets of palo santo are deftly highlighted  the citric effervescence,  piney cool,  and minty lightness. A supporting note of balsamic Atlas cedar adds to the creamy-yet-shimmering wood. A wood that releases its healing,  cleansing scent when burned,  it is unlike any other,  with pale smoke tendrils rising in subtle shades of incense and myrrh. As this soothing scent develops,  you can really feel the mastery of Alexandra Monet,  who's devised a way to approximate the feel of a holy incense that burns to clean white ash - leaving just a wisp of sacred smoke on the skin. Mystical,  yet contemporary and wholly fresh."," Bergamot, petitgrain, nutmeg, palo santo, Atlas cedar, Hedione, incense, myrrh, musks",originally release le15 onetime limited offering celebrate different companys 15year anniversary distinguished creation santo incensio sillage sacra exactly formulation release new name new life describe asa sacred perfume draws secret shamanic stance like prayer sky showcase supreme holy wood rarely use perfumery palo santo opening spark bright flame tart smoky invoke begin ritual fizzy orbs bergamot petitgrain crackle delicate shaving nutmeg fragrant spicy time vetiverinfuse plume smoke rise palo santo make entrance sacred wood elevated high chic far cry rustic bundle wood like glow elegant veil meditative ground enchanting contradictory facet palo santo deftly highlight citric effervescence piney cool minty lightness support note balsamic atlas cedar add creamyyetshimmere wood wood release healing cleanse scent burn unlike pale smoke tendril rise subtle shade incense myrrh soothe scent develop really feel mastery alexandra monet devise way approximate feel holy incense burns clean white ash leave wisp sacred smoke skin mystical yet contemporary wholly fresh
dragonfly eau de parfum,Zoologist," Drifting through swaying reeds and billowing stalks of papyrus, a breeze gives chase to a sweet morning mist. A perfect mirror, revealed upon still green water, is shattered by a sudden shower, casting the gentle romance of lotus and iris into a frenzied, passionate rhythm. High above, tendrils of sunlight nudge away the grey clouds, their warmth drawing dense aromas from the dewy surfaces below. Beneath the dwindling ripples, restless nymphs stir and begin to emerge. Under the soft moonlight, the newly-hatched dragonflies spread fragile, virgin wings, poised to explore the world between pool and sky.Like a glade captured in delicate strokes upon an impressionist canvas, the rich, green floral medley of Zoologist Dragonfly transports you through a maze of moody tones and melancholy weather. This olfactory journey echoes the cycle of a cobalt pond, from the crackling light of dawn to the thick blanket of nightfall, under the gaze of the flitting dragonfly."," Aldehydes, Heliotrope, Lemon, Peony, Rainwater, Cherry Blossom, Clover, Iris, Lotus, Rice, Amber, Moss, Musk, Papyrus, Sandalwood",drifting sway reed billow stalk papyrus breeze give chase sweet morning mist perfect mirror reveal upon still green water shatter sudden shower cast gentle romance lotus iris frenzied passionate rhythm high tendril sunlight nudge away grey cloud warmth draw dense aromas dewy surface beneath dwindle ripples restless nymphs stir begin emerge soft moonlight newlyhatched dragonfly spread fragile virgin wing poise explore world pool sky like glade capture delicate stroke upon impressionist canvas rich green floral medley zoologist dragonfly transport maze moody tone melancholy weather olfactory journey echo cycle cobalt pond crackle light dawn thick blanket nightfall gaze flit dragonfly
united arab emirates aoud extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," United Arab Emirates Spirit Of The Union, or UAE Aoud for short, is Roja Dove's love letter to the people of the Middle East who joyfully douse themselves in the richest and most luxurious of fragrances. For a sensualist such as Roja Dove, these are his spirit animals  men unafraid to wear the richest and creamiest of rose fragrances, and women who proudly wore the most animalic of ouds. UAE Aoud pays tribute to this taste for exuberance and luxury by loading up on the most sumptuous raw materials in the world  the costliest Taifi rose ottos, the smokiest, most refined Laotian oud, and the finest floral absolutes and concretes available this side of Grasse. Supported by a creamy mÃ©lange of white and yellow flowers such as jasmine, gardenia, and ylang, a bright, pure Taifi rose sings out, clearly the top-billing soprano. The leathery, animalic oud note is sharpened by an undercurrent of civet, but buried deep enough in a cloud of benzoin and spices to soften its impact. The roses, white flowers, and creamy civet come together over a dense, smoky layer of resins, woods, and oud, creating a shimmering, sensual halo of a scent."," Artemisia, bergamot, black currant, cloves, geranium, jasmine, rose, taif rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, benzoin, labdanum, civet, guaiac wood, incense, musk, oakmoss, patchouli, pink pepper",united arab emirates spirit union uae aoud short roja dove love letter people middle east joyfully douse rich luxurious fragrance sensualist roja dove spirit animal man unafraid wear rich creamy rise fragrance woman proudly wear animalic ouds uae aoud pays tribute taste exuberance luxury loading sumptuous raw material world costliest taifi rise ottos smoky refined laotian oud fine floral absolute concrete available side grasse support creamy malange white yellow flower jasmine gardenia ylang bright pure taifi rise sing clearly topbille soprano leathery animalic oud note sharpen undercurrent civet bury deep enough cloud benzoin spice soften impact rose white flower creamy civet come together dense smoky layer resin wood oud create shimmering sensual halo scent
la douceur de siam eau de parfum,Dusita," A perfume of strange, nocturnal beauty, La Douceur de Siam is like walking into a Thai spice garden overhung with night-blooming flowers. Creamy, dreamy, what could have been another pretty, classically composed white floral is sparked by vivid green notes and given a voluptuous exoticism with ylang-ylang, frangipani and champaca. La Douceur de Siam opens with a hothouse smell of stemmy greenery and a thorny rose so sharp you'd swear it had fangs. But soon, warm sandalwood arrives along with a soothing hint of vanilla to blanket the composition, and the rose becomes lush and welcoming. But the heart of La Douceur de Siam is the heady champaca flower  a cousin to gardenia with a suggestion of lime blossom and gentle spice. Douceur's champaca is hypnotically beautiful, languorous, suspended between peachy frangipani and dense, ripe ylang-ylang. As the notes develop and intertwine, the white flowers, rose and champaca harmonize on a bed of velvety clove and dry amber. The silken thread tying together spicy, fresh and silky notes in perfect harmony shows once again creator Pissara Umavijani s ability to introduce unexpected elements into classically composed genres.

le sillage blanc eau de parfum,Dusita," Inspired by Piguet's Bandit, Sillage Blanc is a modern chypre with a retro soul. This is Bandit with better manners and an independent streak of its own. With its bright herbal opening, Sillage Blanc is a chypre-leather riff, fresh, alternately crisp and mossy. Bandit's sharp greenness and fierce leather are there, but the rough edges have been smoothed out. Where Bandit is an emerald-eyed dominatrix cracking a horsewhip, Sillage Blanc is an urban garconne sporting a Kelly leather bag.Sillage Blanc opens with smack of bright green galbanum sharp as a nip-waisted suit. But soapy-sweet neroli soon tones down the galbanum bite, and orange blossom adds a touch of creamy florals. Sillage Blanc is not, however, simply Bandit's more genteel sibling. Little Sis has a naughty side of her own. A green, moist tobacco note adds an earthy, illicit quality. The bitter herbal notes are distinctive, amped up with artemisia and a vegetal ambrette before settling down on a mossy, woodsy bed. Completely unisex, Sillage Blanc is like a well-made Campari cocktail held by a gloved hand bitter, leathery perfection."," Orange blossom, Neroli, Tobacco, Artemisia, Galbanum, Leather, Ambrette seed, Patchouli, Oakmoss",inspire piguet bandit sillage blanc modern chypre retro soul bandit well manners independent streak bright herbal opening sillage blanc chypreleather riff fresh alternately crisp mossy bandit sharp greenness fierce leather rough edges smooth bandit emeraldeye dominatrix crack horsewhip sillage blanc urban garconne sport kelly leather bag sillage blanc open smack bright green galbanum sharp nipwaiste suit soapysweet neroli soon tone galbanum bite orange blossom add touch creamy floral sillage blanc not however simply bandit genteel sible little sis naughty side green moist tobacco note add earthy illicit quality bitter herbal note distinctive amped artemisia vegetal ambrette settle mossy woodsy bed completely unisex sillage blanc like wellmade campari cocktail hold gloved hand bitter leathery perfection

hacivat extrait de parfum,Nishane," Move over, because there's a new masculine in town, and guys, you're going to love this one. With tart, sparkling citrus draped over a backbone crisp with forest woods, oakmoss, and white jasmine, Hacivat recalls the oakmoss-laden glory of woody chypres like Pour Monsieur that once populated men's perfumery. Despite the solidly classical lines of the scent, Hacivat feels entirely modern, with a juicy pineapple note aerating the damp mosses and woods, and a touch of blackcurrant leaf keeping the tone fresh and outdoorsy. Don't be afraid of that pineapple note. Rich and natural-smelling rather than sporty or cheap, the pineapple note is so well done here that it redeems the reputation of the much-maligned fruit. Hacivat wears on the skin as lightly as a white linen shirt in summer. It is discreet, professional, and sparklingly clean, but possessed of just enough bitter moss and woods for gravitas. A rare, classically-built woody chypre with a contemporary edge, Hacivat just smells really wonderful and will make other people think you smell great too.

karagoz extrait de parfum,Nishane," Meaningblack eye, this fragrance is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays, Karagoz, who plays the traditional, hearty peasant to Hacivat's educated statesman character. Despite Hacivat's constant efforts to civilize Karagoz, he remains joyfully honest, straightforward, and witty. Karagoz, the fragrance, is as pleasantly down-to-earth as the character it emulates. Although it features the same pineapple as in Hacivat, Karagoz's treatment of it couldn't be more different. Where Hacivat is dark, crisp, and elegant, Karagoz is hearty and rustic, with a rich array of harvest fruits, herbs, and sunburned grass notes framing the juicy tartness of the pineapple. It is at once fresh and outdoorsy, but also waxily sweet with hay and amber. Despite the rude cornucopia of harvest notes, though, Karagoz turns out to be very modern in feel, thanks to the dry, quasi-industrial oud note in the base that drapes the scent in a rich, metallic shimmer. Like the shadow play character, Karagoz has a booming, fleshed-out presence that's very difficult to ignore.

zenne extrait de parfum,Nishane," Zenne is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays  a woman whose voluptuous beauty is capable of bringing men to their knees. And Zenne the fragrance is every bit as self-confident, flirtatious, and pretty as the character it emulates. Think of the softest, rosiest blackcurrant musk you can imagine, glazed with milky musk and turned into a cloud of pink marshmallows, and that is Zenne.It begins in the palace garden, with a volley of pink grapefruit, rhubarb, and blackcurrant leaf, tart with morning dew. It is innocent, yet juicy and seductive. Slowly, piquant blackcurrants begin to pop against a cloudy backdrop of milky sandalwood, musk, and gardenia, staining the cream with purple juice. In the midst of all this, a rich Turkish rose ripens, slicking the tart, starchy berries and rhubarb with rose syrup, and adding body and thickness to the scent. A nugget of salty, chewy ambergris in the base extends the golden glow of the scent, giving it the sexy insolence for which the character of Zenne is known. Zenne is both innocent and come-hither  whipped up into a gentle pink froth of tart berries, creamy musks, and rich red roses, it presents an appeal that's hard to resist."," Grapefruit, blackcurrant (cassis), rhubarb, Turkish rose, gardenia, sandalwood, vanilla, ambergris, musk",zenne tribute fragrance form one stock character ottoman empire shadow play woman whose voluptuous beauty capable bring man knee zenne fragrance every bit selfconfident flirtatious pretty character emulate think soft rosiest blackcurrant musk imagine glaze milky musk turn cloud pink marshmallows zenne begin palace garden volley pink grapefruit rhubarb blackcurrant leaf tart morning dew innocent yet juicy seductive slowly piquant blackcurrant begin pop cloudy backdrop milky sandalwood musk gardenia stain cream purple juice midst rich turkish rise ripens slick tart starchy berry rhubarb rise syrup add body thickness scent nugget salty chewy ambergris base extend golden glow scent give sexy insolence character zenne know zenne innocent comehither whip gentle pink froth tart berry creamy musks rich red rose present appeal hard resist
hundred silent ways extrait de parfum,Nishane," Inspired by a line in a poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi poet,I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways"", Hundred Silent Ways communicates love wordlessly through a series of little flourishes of fruit and flowers as tender as the skin of a loved one. There is an undeniably girlish flirtatiousness about Hundred Silent Ways, but it is also very elegant.The opening is ambrosial and frankly sensual, a Rococo burst of sweet, syrupy peaches, mandarin orange, and tuberose petals so juicy sweet that you will want to gulp it down greedily, heedless of the red juice staining your mouth. Bathed in a cloud of marshmallow-soft musk, the fruit and flowers slowly become more abstract and hazier in feel, but thanks to a touch of cool, powdery iris, it never loses its sparkle. By the time you get to the nutty, savory woodiness of the sandalwood in the base, soaking up all the rich, buttery excesses of gardenia, fruit, and cream, you will have been completely won over by the inviting deliciousness of Hundred Silent Ways. It is the rare fruity floral that seduces you without so much as a word."," Mandarin, tuberose, peach, white jasmine, gardenia, orris, vanilla, sandalwood, vetiver",inspire line poem rumi 13th century sufi poeti close mouth speak hundred silent ways hundred silent ways communicates love wordlessly series little flourish fruit flower tender skin love one undeniably girlish flirtatiousness hundred silent ways also elegant opening ambrosial frankly sensual rococo burst sweet syrupy peach mandarin orange tuberose petal juicy sweet want gulp greedily heedless red juice stain mouth bathe cloud marshmallowsoft musk fruit flower slowly become abstract hazy feel thanks touch cool powdery iris never lose sparkle time get nutty savory woodiness sandalwood base soak rich buttery excess gardenia fruit cream completely win invite deliciousness hundred silent ways rare fruity floral seduce without much word
fan your flames extrait de parfum,Nishane," Inspired by the Sufi poet Rumi's exhortation to; ""Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames, Fan Your Fames is a fiery, semi-gourmand fragrance that is all about the kind of passion that spills over into obsession. Featuring a haze of white shisha smoke over a mÃ©lange of woody coconut husks, booze, and a mossy, balsamic base, Fan Your Flames is a stunning take on tobacco that extends the material in several different directions at once. First, the dried fruit and molasses sweetness of tobacco leaf is drawn out in an exotic direction by way of coconut husk and rum, with a sort of fermented fruit undertone suggestive of Japanese brandy - the kind that costs $500 a bottle. Directly underneath this, coumarin coaxes the hay facets out of the tobacco leaf, introducing a uniquely dry, sunburned grass tonality that tempers the sweetness of the booze. In the base, cooling, greenish hints of fir, cedar, mint, and oakmoss emerge, accentuating the bitter woodiness inherent in dried tobacco leaves. Now imagine all this wrapped up in a haze of tarry smoke, like a leather armchair left to smolder in the ashes of a house fire. Fan Your Flames is intoxicating, obsessive, strange, and almost bewilderingly dense  wear it many times before the smoke starts to lift and you begin to understand its true beauty."," Coconut, rum, tobacco, tonka, oakmoss, cedarwood",inspire sufi poet rumis exhortation set life fire seek fan flame fan fames fiery semigourmand fragrance kind passion spill obsession feature haze white shisha smoke malange woody coconut husk booze mossy balsamic base fan flame stunning take tobacco extend material several different direction first dry fruit molasse sweetness tobacco leaf drawn exotic direction way coconut husk rum sort ferment fruit undertone suggestive japanese brandy kind cost 500 bottle directly underneath coumarin coaxes hay facet tobacco leaf introduce uniquely dry sunburn grass tonality temper sweetness booze base cool greenish hint fir cedar mint oakmoss emerge accentuate bitter woodiness inherent dry tobacco leave imagine wrap haze tarry smoke like leather armchair left smolder ashe house fire fan flame intoxicate obsessive strange almost bewilderingly dense wear many time smoke start lift begin understand true beauty
afrika-olifant extrait de parfum,Nishane," Poised halfway between a masculine chypre and a musky oriental, Africa Olifant exerts a steady fascination over its wearer. But fear not - despite the extraordinary array of animalic notes packed into this scent, Africa Olifant pulls off the remarkable feat of being both richly dirty and a breeze to wear. If you love the mossy funk of old-school masculines like Antaeus, then this will be right down your alley.  The structure of the fragrance is quite clever. Instead of a top-down flow of notes, imagine a glowing core emanating concentric circles of rich aromas that strike the nose all at once  rubber, bone-dry leather, fiery balsam, melting tar, bitter moss, musk. There's also a lot of myrrh, first bathing everything in a haze of smoke and then drying down to a lingering impression of licorice, stone and earth. Everything feels so elemental, and yet, at its core, Africa Olifant is a super-smooth leather with a surprisingly balmy freshness to it. Citrus and herbs provide lift, and a sweet-salty ambergris spotlights everything with its golden glow. The end result is a fragrance that feels solidly classical, but also animalic in a way that not many modern masculines are these days."," Ambergris, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, castoreum, civet, leather, oud, musk",poise halfway masculine chypre musky oriental africa olifant exert steady fascination wearer fear not despite extraordinary array animalic note pack scent africa olifant pull remarkable feat richly dirty breeze wear love mossy funk oldschool masculine like antaeus right alley structure fragrance quite clever instead topdown flow note imagine glow core emanate concentric circle rich aromas strike nose rubber bonedry leather fiery balsam melt tar bitter moss musk also lot myrrh first bathing everything haze smoke drying linger impression licorice stone earth everything feel elemental yet core africa olifant supersmooth leather surprisingly balmy freshness citrus herbs provide lift sweetsalty ambergris spotlight everything golden glow end result fragrance feel solidly classical also animalic way not many modern masculine day
ambra calabria extrait de parfum,Nishane," Ambra Calabria is an unusually fresh, leafy-green amber that departs from the standard model of vanilla and resin so thick you could stand a spoon up in em. The sour bite of Calabrian bergamot and the smoky greenness of the galbanum cut a swath through the amber, blowing it up with salt and air. This is what makes Ambra Calabria such a fantastic wear in hot summer weather.But Ambra Calabria really gives you the best of both worlds. It has all the spiky freshness of a traditional eau de cologne but also all the robustness of a full-blown oriental. So while the opening act is full of tart green and lemony notes that will snap your head to attention, the second act is built for comfort, not speed, with creamy jasmine blossoms tucked behind the ear of a musky, salted caramel base that seems to go on forever. Sweet and inviting on the bottom, tart and energizing on top, Ambra Calabria is the olfactory equivalent of Key Lime pie with a sprinkle of anise and salt on top. Summer in a bottle, dare we say."," Bergamot, galbanum, green leaves, jasmine, coriander, sweet amber, musk, vanilla",ambra calabria unusually fresh leafygreen amber depart standard model vanilla resin thick could stand spoon em sour bite calabrian bergamot smoky greenness galbanum cut swath amber blow salt air make ambra calabria fantastic wear hot summer weather ambra calabria really give good world spiky freshness traditional eau de cologne also robustness fullblown oriental opening act full tart green lemony note snap head attention second act build comfort not speed creamy jasmine blossom tucked behind ear musky salt caramel base seem go forever sweet invite bottom tart energize top ambra calabria olfactory equivalent key lime pie sprinkle anise salt top summer bottle dare say
sultan vetiver extrait de parfum,Nishane," Sultan Vetiver recalls the former glory of Guerlain Vetiver before it was gutted by reforms - earthy, rich, and woody, and with a bitter anisic bite that will make you think of the blackest of licorice. It is a particularly toothsome, rugged example of vetiver, and one that true vetiver enthusiasts should make a point of seeking out. Despite the name, there is nothing particularly oriental about Sultan Vetiver, although there is a richly embroidered nutmeat texture in the drydown suggestive of creamy resin. With impressive focus, the scent hones in on the noble green root, showcasing three separate types of vetiver oil that in turn display a rich variety of facets ranging from salt marsh, hazelnut, freshly-mown grass, rose, black pepper, and citrus fruit. In the base, tonka and amber resin melt away all the pungency of the root, bathing everything in a sweet olive-green bath of creamy goodness. Sultan Vetiver is an authentic vetiver fragrance that just smells amazing  and one that we predict will thrill purists and the vetiver-shy alike."," Java vetiver , anise, pink pepper, bergamot, bourbon vetiver, Haitian vetiver , neroli, tonka bean, amber, leather, Brazilian vetiver",sultan vetiver recall former glory guerlain vetiver gutte reform earthy rich woody bitter anisic bite make think black licorice particularly toothsome rugged example vetiver one true vetiver enthusiast make point seek despite name nothing particularly oriental sultan vetiver although richly embroider nutmeat texture drydown suggestive creamy resin impressive focus scent hone noble green root showcase three separate type vetiver oil turn display rich variety facet range salt marsh hazelnut freshlymown grass rise black pepper citrus fruit base tonka amber resin melt away pungency root bathing everything sweet olivegreen bath creamy goodness sultan vetiver authentic vetiver fragrance smell amazing one predict thrill purist vetivershy alike
suede et safran extrait de parfum,Nishane," SuÃ¨de et Safran uses fiery Iranian saffron and Indian ambrette seed to build one of the most pleasurably buttery suede perfumes in existence. It smells like a soft, dun-colored suede jacket that's been rubbed down with red-gold spice and musk grains until the delicate fibers begin to break down and dissolve into thin air.The juxtaposition between smoke and spice is played just right here, with the scent exerting a subtle undertow of sweetness that's downright addictive. Ambrette seed provides a boozy, unripe fruit note pitched halfway between pear and apple, and the vein of throaty spice lends a dark gingerbread sparkle. Quiet enough for day wear and yet assertive enough to give you billowing sillage on a big night out, SuÃ¨de et Safran is the perfect fragrance for people who love creamy, haute-luxe leathers like Tuscan Leather and Black Saffron, but who want to branch out into a warmer, drier direction."," Ambrette seed, saffron, suede, ginger, musk, caraway",sua de et safran use fiery iranian saffron indian ambrette seed build one pleasurably buttery suede perfumes existence smell like soft duncolore suede jacket rub redgold spice musk grain delicate fiber begin break dissolve thin air juxtaposition smoke spice play right scent exert subtle undertow sweetness downright addictive ambrette seed provide boozy unripe fruit note pitch halfway pear apple vein throaty spice lend dark gingerbread sparkle quiet enough day wear yet assertive enough give billow sillage big night sua de et safran perfect fragrance people love creamy hauteluxe leather like tuscan leather black saffron want branch warm drier direction
pachuli kozha extrait de parfum,Nishane," Kozha meansskin in Turkish, so if you're thinking that Patchouli Kozha mixes sensual, skin-like notes with the earthiness of patchouli, then you'd be right. But Patchouli Kozha is so much more than that. In fact, before we get down to the loam, we must first pass through a meadow, the scent opening unexpectedly on a naturalistic accord of grass and flowers, wet and torn after a violent storm. The opening crackles with ozone and electricity, hyacinth striding to the fore, a green, almost bitter artemisia at its side. Soon after, one becomes aware of a potent, sensuous ylang ylang snaking its way out of the grass, ripe with banana flesh and leathery indole. But the humid, near tropical smell of the ylang is held in check by the bright, peppery patchouli, and together these notes create a light, raw leather redolent with mint leaf and anise. The patchouli-ylang pairing is not particularly earthy or sweet, but cool and herbaceous - effortlessly sexy in a natural, tousled-hair kind of way. In the base, a sweeter tone creeps in, honey and resin thickening the patchouli, and giving it a warm, rounded feel. Towards the far drydown, a nubbin of frankincense weaves in and out of the honeyed patchouli and florals, drying everything out in a silvery haze of smoke and ether."," Hyacinth, ylang ylang, artemisia, chamomile, patchouli, black pepper, leather, honey, incense",kozha meansskin turkish think patchouli kozha mix sensual skinlike note earthiness patchouli would right patchouli kozha much fact get loam must first pass meadow scent opening unexpectedly naturalistic accord grass flower wet tear violent storm opening crackle ozone electricity hyacinth stride fore green almost bitter artemisia side soon one become aware potent sensuous ylang ylang snake way grass ripe banana flesh leathery indole humid near tropical smell ylang hold check bright peppery patchouli together note create light raw leather redolent mint leaf anise patchouliylang pair not particularly earthy sweet cool herbaceous effortlessly sexy natural tousledhair kind way base sweeter tone creeps honey resin thickening patchouli give warm round feel towards far drydown nubbin frankincense weave honey patchouli floral drying everything silvery haze smoke ether
tuberoza extrait de parfum,Nishane," If Tuberoza had a color, it would be a mixture of yellows and golds. Know why we like this one? Because unlike most tuberose fragrances that try to restrain the natural fleshiness of tuberose, Tuberoza sets it free to be its gorgeous, sunny self. Framed by sweet orangey notes, ylang, and honeyed orange blossom, the tuberose smells magnificent here: a flashy explosion of creamy, tropical sweetness, with an undercurrent of fuel, banana custard, and rubber. This is tuberose with all the lights turned on. No effort has been made to dim its naturally bright, loud character. Instead, tropical ylang and gardenia coax it out further into the sun, encouraging an expansion of its creamy, sweet excesses. Amber and marigold, as bright as a newly-minted gold coin, glitters underneath, and in the base, the scent gets a double helping of cream with the addition of a full-fat sandalwood and pearly white musk. Put this on and gasp with pleasure as Tuberoza billows softly across your skin like a giant, golden nuclear mushroom cloud. Its bolshy, take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, and the end result totally worth the ride."," Ylang ylang, orange blossom, artemisia, tuberose, jasmine, marigold, amberwood, vetiver, sandalwood, musk",tuberoza color would mixture yellow golds know like one unlike tuberose fragrance try restrain natural fleshiness tuberose tuberoza set free gorgeous sunny self frame sweet orangey note ylang honey orange blossom tuberose smell magnificent flashy explosion creamy tropical sweetness undercurrent fuel banana custard rubber tuberose light turn no effort make dim naturally bright loud character instead tropical ylang gardenia coax sun encourage expansion creamy sweet excess amber marigold bright newlyminte gold coin glitter underneath base scent get double help cream addition fullfat sandalwood pearly white musk put gasp pleasure tuberoza billow softly across skin like giant golden nuclear mushroom cloud bolshy takenoprisoner attitude refreshing end result totally worth ride

Spectacular.-MachusA brilliantly dark graphic novel, A City On Fire, is the story of two match-makers. Rupert literally fabricates matches in a factory on the waterfront while Frances writes a dating column for the city's newspaper.

That changes one fortuitous evening when they are both witness to the same high-profile murder and are forced to come together as an unlikely vigilante pair in order to save their own names.This scent is literally on fire - dark with firewood and spice, evoking both urban landscapes and the great outdoors, with smoke plumes rising into the air.

slow explosions eau de parfum,Imaginary Authors,"I was lost,  aimless,  and depressed. Now I'm only two of those things.-Gwen K. VroomenIn 1980,  Gwen K. Vroomen quit a monotonous job,  went to the corner bar,  and  on the bartender's urging  threw a dart at a world map tacked on the wall. She had never heard of Goa but knew immediately she needed to go. Three months later she was celebrating Hindu New Year at a tea garden high in the hills of Kerala,  fireworks exploding below. She wrote of that night:I was resuscitated by color,  redeemed by the vibrant unknown. Her self-proclaimedJourney out of darkness,  dotted with unforgettable stories of night markets,  river floats,  and harrowing moped rides,  inspired a generation of young Americans eager to buck the drudgery of ordinary life. With pops of rose and hits of saffron,  this scent explodes on the skin and awakens the senses. Every inhale will open you up to the idea of escape,  push you to take risks,  and embolden you to get truly lost.

saint julep eau de parfum,Imaginary Authors,"Tomorrow I will fight but tonight I recline into a sweet dream of muddled mint and ice. Milton NeversOn the outskirts of Clarksdale, Mississippi, at the end of a secluded dirt road sat a small ramshackle church. It was not a place of worship but rather where many went to seek refuge during impoverished times. Legend has it the structure was transported to the wild mint field by hand, hoisted on the shoulders of two dozen men. The outside remained simple and nondescript but the interior was aglow with pilfered neon signs, Christmas lights, and a jukebox donated by the sheriff's son. It was a distinctly secular place where locals who knew where to find it could share moonshine, socialize, and dance their troubles away. They called their ramshackle juke joint Saint Julep and the oral histories compiled within paint a picture of that magical place wherethe smiles was always free and salvation had the distinct smell of sweet mint.This scent is like a mint julep in the heat of the south, complete with invigorating mint leaves and a light bourbon body, with an added ""ice"" accord, sugar and a hint of magnolia. All of this adds up to arguably the perfect hot-weather scent."," Sweet mint, tangerine, southern magnolia, bourbon, grisalva, sugarcube, crushed ice",tomorrow fight tonight recline sweet dream muddle mint ice milton never outskirt clarksdale mississippi end seclude dirt road sat small ramshackle church not place worship rather many go seek refuge impoverished time legend structure transport wild mint field hand hoist shoulder two dozen man outside remain simple nondescript interior aglow pilfer neon sign christmas light jukebox donate sheriff son distinctly secular place local know find could share moonshine socialize dance trouble away call ramshackle juke joint saint julep oral history compile within paint picture magical place wherethe smile always free salvation distinct smell sweet mint scent like mint julep heat south complete invigorate mint leave light bourbon body add ice accord sugar hint magnolia add arguably perfect hotweather scent

close up eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," From the inner self to the outside world, from the smallest to the largest, the composition of Close Up revels in contrast and the oscillation between opposites. In continuing with Olfactive Studio's photographic inspirations, Close Up takes gourmand notes of coffee and cherry, and zooms in and out with both intensity and subtlety.There is the appearance of the unexpected in every note. Close Up opens with a cherry that is not candy sweet, but sour, liquor-soaked, and complex as a Griotte cherry. Blooming with a fine dusting of spices with anise, the cherry is paired with green coffee beans, bitter and lightly reminiscent of its roasted twin. Here, the gourmand becomes a departure from the quotidian, and enters a strange universe where everything appears anew. When there is a nutty, toasted quality to the scent, it comes not from the coffee but from tobacco, multifaceted and warm. Close Up is blended expertly, with the gourmand notes transitioning seamlessly into woods, amber, and purring musks. Not so much a delicious gourmand, but an acquired, refined, ever-changing taste, Close Up reveals distinct and sophisticated new aspects along every stage of its engaging journey."," Green coffee, fresh spices, Griotte cherry, blonde tobacco, patchouli, atlas cedarwood, Centifolia rose, amber, musk, tonka bean",inner self outside world small large composition close revel contrast oscillation opposite continue olfactive studio photographic inspiration close take gourmand note coffee cherry zoom intensity subtlety appearance unexpected every note close open cherry not candy sweet sour liquorsoaked complex griotte cherry blooming fine dusting spice anise cherry pair green coffee bean bitter lightly reminiscent roast twin gourmand become departure quotidian enter strange universe everything appear anew nutty toast quality scent come not coffee tobacco multifacete warm close blend expertly gourmand note transitioning seamlessly wood amber purr musks not much delicious gourmand acquire refined everchange taste close reveal distinct sophisticated new aspect along every stage engage journey

bull's blood eau de parfum,Imaginary Authors,"A man who has killed is a man who knows passion.-Devante ValÃ©reoDevante ValÃ©reo was raised in a dusty Spanish village on the Balearic Sea. He fondly recalled going to the bullfights with his father,  an ex-picador,  and credited those early experiences with inspiring his most popular novella,  Bull's Blood.

Though the charges were rejected by the court,  a ban on the sale of his works persisted for a number of years.A fixture in Barcelona,  smoking cigarillos and writing in the cafÃ©s and bars into the night,  ValÃ©reo disappeared as a fugitive in 1967 after a highly publicized bar scuffle with American sailors,  one of whom later died from his injuries.A man who has killed,  he wrote in Bull's Blood, is a man who knows passion. No exaggeration here,  this is a highly animalic scent not for the faint of heart."," Patchouli, rose, costus root, tobacco, black musk, bull's blood",man kill man know passiondevante valareo devante valareo raise dusty spanish village balearic sea fondly recall go bullfight father expicador credit early experience inspire popular novella bull blood book lurid tale seduction garner obscenity charge author though charge reject court ban sale work persist number year fixture barcelona smoking cigarillos writing cafas bar night valareo disappear fugitive 1967 highly publicize bar scuffle american sailor one later die injuriesa man kill write bull blood man know passion no exaggeration highly animalic scent not faint heart

empathy eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Empathy is the meeting of two minds, and in this eponymous perfume, there is a meeting of two elements that are just as simpatico with each other: a bright, boozy raspberry-pear accord and a smoky, ashy tobacco. Although it leans slightly feminine, anyone who appreciates Tuscan Leather should take note.The fruit element is playful and interesting: the raspberry is not the hyper-sugared variant seen in fruitchoulis, but rather a tart, fuzzy variant soaked in the Cognac-like richness of davana and pear juice. Rising up to meet and subsume it is a wave of darker, more serious elements  a Patrician accord of cigarillo ash, dry tobacco, and musk, all of which merge into a grey suede that touches briefly on Tuscan Leather but skitters away again into something creamier and hazier. The bright raspberry endures throughout, and actually kind of symbolizes the appeal of this scent: sparkling but sturdy and tenacious. A fruit scent with steel in its backbone."," Pear blossom, raspberry flowers, Indian davana, fruity tobacco, raspberry infusion, scorched wood, transparent mosses, benzoin, silver fir, Irian oud",empathy meeting two mind eponymous perfume meeting two element simpatico bright boozy raspberrypear accord smoky ashy tobacco although leans slightly feminine anyone appreciates tuscan leather take note fruit element playful interesting raspberry not hypersugare variant see fruitchoulis rather tart fuzzy variant soak cognaclike richness davana pear juice rise meet subsume wave darker serious element patrician accord cigarillo ash dry tobacco musk merge grey suede touch briefly tuscan leather skitter away something creamy hazy bright raspberry endure throughout actually kind symbolize appeal scent sparkle sturdy tenacious fruit scent steel backbone
altruist eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," This is the new Eau de Parfum version of Altruist, originally released in 2016 as a collaboration between J.F. Schwarzlose and the Berlin artist Paul deFlorian. The result of a series of intense conversations between perfumer VÃ©ronique Nyberg and deFlorian, every note in Altruist represents a color or brushstroke from one of deFlorian's paintings. It is an unusual concept for a perfume, but one that works so beautifully it's been shortlisted for the Independent Perfume category in the Art and Olfaction Awards 2017. Altruist opens with fresh, sparkling notes of bergamot, lemon, and ginger representing the swirls of light green and aquamarine colors on the painting, while the warmer slashes of red and orange on the canvas are translated via the explosive heat of cracked black pepper and nutmeg. The almost sterilefroideur of the man's sightless gaze in the painting is portrayed through use of a special MANE captive molecule called Aqual, which gives the scent a cold, crystalline shimmer, like sunlight on a diamond. For the new EDP version, the perfumer and artist decided to add Ambrarome, a material that gives the perfume a dense, dry woodiness with an undertone of something moist and bitter, creating the delightful effect of paper dipped in Japanese calligraphy ink. DeFlorian himself calls Altruist ascent for feminists, cyborgs and survivors, and in our opinion, it is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a balance between the sappy freshness of citrus and the tinder-dry crackle of woods and spice."," bergamot, lemon, ginger, watery notes, rose, orange blossom, nutmeg, black pepper, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, ambrarome",new eau de parfum version altruist originally release 2016 collaboration jf schwarzlose berlin artist paul deflorian result series intense conversation perfumer varonique nyberg deflorian every note altruist represent color brushstroke one deflorians painting unusual concept perfume one work beautifully shortlisted independent perfume category art olfaction award 2017 altruist open fresh sparkle note bergamot lemon ginger represent swirls light green aquamarine color painting warm slash red orange canvas translate via explosive heat crack black pepper nutmeg almost sterilefroideur mans sightless gaze painting portrayed use special mane captive molecule call aqual give scent cold crystalline shimmer like sunlight diamond new edp version perfumer artist decide add ambrarome material give perfume dense dry woodiness undertone something moist bitter create delightful effect paper dip japanese calligraphy ink deflorian call altruist ascent feminist cyborgs survivors opinion perfect summer fragrance like balance sappy freshness citrus tinderdry crackle wood spice
leder 6 eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Leder. Even the sound of the German word for leather sounds Ã¼ber naughty, doesn't it? But if you're worried that Leder 6 is a hardcore leather with the full-on kink factor of a Berlin night club, then rest easy  it's not. With its notes of hot milk, candy, and rubber, Leder 6 is more rakish than kinky. More importantly, it's gorgeous and all kinds of addictive.Leder 6 starts out with a creamy white leather accord that's as ergonomically smooth as the interior of a brand new Porsche. The suede upholstery, although streamlined and modern in feel, is enriched with accents of warm vanilla milk, white chocolate, candied apricots, and a strange but delicious biscuit-like tone. At first steamy and moist, the fragrance grows increasingly dry and powdery, with notes of rubber, resin, and gun smoke emerging in the drydown. In the final tally, we find Leder 6's heady mix of rubber and milk to be bold and exotic, but also as inviting as a deeply-powdered bosom. A fragrance that titillates rather than provokes, and in our opinion, all the better for it."," Osmanthus, saffron, leather, milk, vanilla, incense, styrax",leder even sound german word leather sound a14ber naughty not worried leder 6 hardcore leather fullon kink factor berlin night club rest easy not note hot milk candy rubber leder 6 rakish kinky importantly gorgeous kind addictive leder 6 start creamy white leather accord ergonomically smooth interior brand new porsche suede upholstery although streamline modern feel enrich accent warm vanilla milk white chocolate candy apricot strange delicious biscuitlike tone first steamy moist fragrance grow increasingly dry powdery note rubber resin gun smoke emerge drydown final tally find leder 6s heady mix rubber milk bold exotic also invite deeplypowdere bosom fragrance titillate rather provoke opinion well
zeitgeist eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Think all modern marine fragrances rely too heavily on the melon sweetness of Calone? Try Zeitgeist. It's the rare marine fragrance that, although composed of a long list of laboratory molecules, pulls off the feat of smelling utterly natural.  If you love the collected smells caught in your sweater after a walk on a cold beach  ozone, salt, minerals, and the faint musk of warm skin  then this fragrance is for you. Structured around the salty glitter of ambergris and the damp, almost fruity greenness of seaweed, Zeitgeist works beautifully on both girls and boys who love the Great Outdoors. The scent gains lift through a complex arrangement of musks, infusing the structure with space and air, and making it a feather-light wear. Warmed through from the base with a golden nugget of spicy Peru balsam and dusty woods, there is an exquisite balance between the briny wetness of the ocean and the dryness of driftwood. Zeitgeist is a subtly sexy fragrance for summer that makes us hear the roar of the ocean even when we're stuck inside."," Amber Xtreme, Peru balsam, Calone, seaweed, Nebulone, Edelonide, Leatherwood",think modern marine fragrance rely heavily melon sweetness calone try zeitgeist rare marine fragrance although compose long list laboratory molecules pull feat smell utterly natural love collect smell catch sweater walk cold beach ozone salt mineral faint musk warm skin fragrance structure around salty glitter ambergris damp almost fruity greenness seaweed zeitgeist work beautifully girl boy love great outdoors scent gain lift complex arrangement musks infuse structure space air make featherlight wear warm base golden nugget spicy peru balsam dusty wood exquisite balance briny wetness ocean dryness driftwood zeitgeist subtly sexy fragrance summer make us hear roar ocean even stick inside
rausch eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Rausch means rush in German, and boy, they weren't kidding - this is one powerful rush to the head that you won't forget in a hurry. One spritz of this stunning fragrance and you are ready for a night of Berlin-style debauchery that even Baudelaire would be proud of. Rausch starts us off in a haze of dry smoke from the club, dark and thrillingly bitter on the tongue, woody and strange. Then a roar of golden oud and amber suddenly swells up from beneath, engulfing your senses in a tidal wave of aged whiskey, red pepper, and rich, resiny balsam. There is plenty of earthy patchouli, a musky, dirty vanilla too, which in combination with the leathery oud gives the fragrance the feel of something depraved and illicit, something dug up from undisturbed soil. Deeply sexy in an almost bewildering way, the raunchy Rausch is a fragrance that broadcasts at ten paces and is therefore perfect for the clubs: wear this and find men, women, and children drawn to you as if you've rolled around in catnip."," Red pepper, sandalwood, cypriol, patchouli, vanilla bean, amber, oud",rausch mean rush german boy not kid one powerful rush head not forget hurry one spritz stunning fragrance ready night berlinstyle debauchery even baudelaire would proud rausch start us haze dry smoke club dark thrillingly bitter tongue woody strange roar golden oud amber suddenly swells beneath engulfing sense tidal wave aged whiskey red pepper rich resiny balsam plenty earthy patchouli musky dirty vanilla combination leathery oud give fragrance feel something depraved illicit something dug undisturbed soil deeply sexy almost bewilder way raunchy rausch fragrance broadcast ten pace therefore perfect club wear find man woman child drawn roll around catnip
ia-33 eau de parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose," Named for the original car license plate of pre-war Berlin, 1A-33 is J. F. Schwarzlose's first modern retooling of one of their heritage perfumes. If you're thinking there's a classic tone to this perfume, then you'd be right, especially with the scent's emphasis on the rich aroma of linden blossom trees in full bloom along the famous Unter den Linden Boulevard in Berlin. It draws the mind immediately to the bourgeois pleasures of sipping tea and reading the morning news in a cafÃ© in the dappled shade.  But this is not a perfume drowning under the weight of nostalgia - it is neither staid nor powdery. In fact, in its perfectly-judged balance between the creamy honey of magnolia, linden blossom, and jasmine and the sharpness of pink pepper and mandarin, 1A-33 reveals itself to be a thoroughly modern fragrance. It's this peppery little kick to the gait of this perfume that makes it such a joy to wear, especially on cool, sunny mornings. One spray of this and you're guaranteed to feel all the euphoria of spring in Berlin, flowers and leaves bursting into life above your head.

blossom love eau de parfum,Amouage," Fresh with the vibrant romance of springtime, Blossom Love is as resplendent as the blossoming cherry trees that give inspiration to this new addition to Amouage's Secret Garden collection. Bright, beautiful, and gently gourmand, it's the perfect scent to greet the changing weather, a paean to the joy and meaning inherent in the transition of the seasons. Opening with the luscious freshness of cherry blossoms suspended in a lightly boozy rose liqueur, Blossom Love gives an almost instantaneous feeling of giddiness, tempered with just enough restraint to never lose its youthful energy. A sweet floral heart, ylang touched with amaretto, is equally bubbly, making our mouths water and our hearts burst forth with seasonal enthusiasm. A rich yet understated drydown of tonka, sandalwood and vanilla likewise exudes a solar warmth, never crossing over into dessert territory but rather suspending us in a near-weightless bliss, a deeply romantic springtime fantasy that seems to hover above the ground. Cherry blossoms are all the more beautiful for how fleeting their bloom can be. With Blossom Love, that unabashed beauty can now be enjoyed any day of the year."," Cherry blossom nectar, rose liquor, ylang ylang, amaretto, vanilla, tonka bean, sandalwood, cashmeran",fresh vibrant romance springtime blossom love resplendent blossom cherry tree give inspiration new addition amouage secret garden collection bright beautiful gently gourmand perfect scent greet change weather paean joy meaning inherent transition season opening luscious freshness cherry blossom suspend lightly boozy rise liqueur blossom love give almost instantaneous feel giddiness temper enough restraint never lose youthful energy sweet floral heart ylang touch amaretto equally bubbly make mouth water heart burst forth seasonal enthusiasm rich yet understate drydown tonka sandalwood vanilla likewise exude solar warmth never crossing dessert territory rather suspend us nearweightless bliss deeply romantic springtime fantasy seem hover ground cherry blossom beautiful fleeting bloom blossom love unabashed beauty enjoyed day year
epidor eau de parfum,Lubin," Inspired by the enduring traditions of the autumn wheat harvest in France, Epidor is not simply a fragrance, but a portal to a simpler time. Originally introduced in 1912, Epidor evokes images of sun-kissed youth from farming villages, exhausted from a hard day's work, resting in the newly cropped fields and daydreaming about the night's celebrations, and hopefully, romances. Epidor's nostalgically lovely scent is built around the multifaceted richness of tonka bean, a material that can elicit tones of fresh hay, vanilla, and sweet florals all at once, but the fragrance opens first with a rich autumnal blend of sweet, musky violet and juicy plum, followed quickly by a lushly natural white floral heart of jasmine and orange blossom. By the time the tonka asserts itself, we're deeply enthralled, awash in the warmth of the setting sun and the bucolic splendor of the French countryside. Gentle, comforting and evocative, Epidor is a fragrance of simple, wondrous beauty."," Violet, plum, jasmine, orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",inspire endure tradition autumn wheat harvest france epidor not simply fragrance portal simple time originally introduce 1912 epidor evoke image sunkissed youth farming village exhausted hard day work rest newly crop field daydream night celebration hopefully romance epidor nostalgically lovely scent build around multifacete richness tonka bean material elicit tone fresh hay vanilla sweet floral fragrance open first rich autumnal blend sweet musky violet juicy plum follow quickly lushly natural white floral heart jasmine orange blossom time tonka assert deeply enthral awash warmth set sun bucolic splendor french countryside gentle comfort evocative epidor fragrance simple wondrous beauty
sole di positano eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," There is nothing like the thrill of a good citrus to refresh on a hot summer's day, and this is a superb rendition. Although done very much in the style of Neroli Portofino with its bitter, sun-drenched citrus notes, Sole di Positano offers a more Spring-like variation by adding wet, fresh green notes like lily of the valley and shiso leaf, and a graceful oakmoss drydown that smells like cool shade and oaked wine. But still, this is the Amalfi coast, and the citrus notes reign supreme. The bitter green and yellow fizz of bergamot, bitter orange, lemons, and shiso act like a cold shower on a hot day, drenching the wearer in icy freshness from head to toe. Pull your nose back from the skin, and it is the cool, soapy neroli and orange blossom that lingers most in the air, providing for a clever dual effect of bitter citrus up close and crisp white floral from afar. Arched over a sturdy, mossy base andfixed in place by the florals and herbs, this effect goes on forever.

absolue d'osmanthe eau de parfum,Perris Monte Carlo," If osmanthus is having a moment in modern perfumery, it's a well-deserved one: elegantly fruity, sensual and softly creamy, it's long past time that this beautiful floral stepped out of the supporting shadows and into the limelight. And it would be hard to think of a more impressive debutante than Absolue d'Osmanthe, an utterly stunning new floral scent fresh off of taking Esxence 2017 by storm and now ready to go worldwide. Fresh and fruity, but also richly mouthwatering and romantic, this is everything we always suspected a perfect osmanthus scent could be. Absolue d'Osmanthe wastes no time putting its gorgeous title ingredient front and center, opening bright and fruity with the apricot-like tones the flower is known for. As with all great soliflore scents, the supporting notes are meant less to twist the fragrance in any particular direction and more to coax out each facet of the featured player, and Absolue completely delivers: plum to add juicy depth to the fruity notes and rose and jasmine to accentuate the luscious softness.

vanille blackberry,Comptoir Sud Pacifique," A heavenly exercise by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, exploring the possibilities for a fragrance both fresh and velvety-soft. Vanille Blackberry sings brightly from the start, opening playfully tart with a burst of fizzing lemon and bergamot. Then, the lovely cloud of floral fruit takes over, with rose and jasmine in attendance, but never too heady, just light and pretty. But in the billowing cloud, the stars of the show are blackberry and vanilla, forming a sweet, velvety-soft melange. The blackberry creates a perfect, lightly piquant contrast to the swoon-worthy classic Comptoir Sud Pacifique vanilla. Like a tea-time delicacy, this soft, floral-fruity vanilla just gets smoother in the drydown, light and delicate, enveloped in white musk and cashmere woods.

une tonne de roses eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," So called because it takes 3.5 tons of rose petals to make just one kilo of rose essence, Une Tonne de Roses has a natural delicacy that belies its hefty name. It opens with a fresh, soft pink rose glistening with the wet sparkle of fruit  green apple or an Asian pear, perhaps. There is also, briefly, a hint of something winey and truffled playing around the edges of the rose, but it never commits to darkness. This is an innocent little rosebud of a rose, just about to burst into being.We start out in Spring, with a dewy rose, but we end up in Fall, with a clean, earthy patchouli. Although more a watercolor than the gouache of Almairac's earlier masterpiece, Voleur de Roses, Une Tonne de Roses completes a similar journey, fading from the pale pink blush of the rose to the golden brown leaf mulch of patchouli. Finishing in a clean, crystalline musk, Une Tonne de Roses strikes us as a Japanese screen version of the ever-popular rose and patchouli combination  delicate, crisp, and achingly pretty."," Rose, patchouli",call take 35 ton rise petal make one kilo rise essence une tonne de rose natural delicacy belie hefty name open fresh soft pink rise glistening wet sparkle fruit green apple asian pear perhaps also briefly hint something winey truffle play around edges rise never commit darkness innocent little rosebud rise burst start spring dewy rise end fall clean earthy patchouli although watercolor gouache almairacs early masterpiece voleur de rose une tonne de rose complete similar journey fade pale pink blush rise golden brown leaf mulch patchouli finish clean crystalline musk une tonne de rose strike us japanese screen version everpopular rise patchouli combination delicate crisp achingly pretty
flavia vanilla eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Inspired by the lyrical, shiny-eyed beauty of an Italian girl called Flavia that Michel Almairac once knew, Flavia Vanilla is a dark, minimally smoky floral vanilla with hints of a tropical, humid ylang ylang playing at its edges. The spiced banana flambÃ© of ylang of the opening notes is as attention-getting as a confident lady who dances her way through a crowded piazzo. But there is also a fresh, youthful breeze running through the perfume  a touch of green magnolia-like notes from the michelia flower that serve to keep the flamboyant sensuality of the custardy ylang firmly in check. Flavia Vanilla is a scent that reminds us that simplicity is the key to true beauty, and that sometimes all that's need is fresh vanilla, flowers, and a trace of smoke to fill the heart with pleasure."," Ylang ylang, michelia, vanilla, sugar",inspire lyrical shinyeyed beauty italian girl call flavia michel almairac know flavia vanilla dark minimally smoky floral vanilla hint tropical humid ylang ylang play edges spice banana flamba ylang opening note attentiongette confident lady dance way crowd piazzo also fresh youthful breeze run perfume touch green magnolialike note michelia flower serve keep flamboyant sensuality custardy ylang firmly check flavia vanilla scent remind us simplicity key true beauty sometimes need fresh vanilla flower trace smoke fill heart pleasure
totally white eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Totally White captures the ethereal, foggy dew of a spring morning in a Parisian city park. It smells like a field of wildflowers waking up en masse. The delicate, slightly honeyed scent of lilac and wisteria mingle with the intoxicatingly bitter, leathery scent of the hawthorn bushes, creating an effect so pollen-rich and watery-cool that you'd forgive early morning joggers for looking dazed and slightly drunk. This is a fragrance whose subtlety might make you forget you're wearing it but for the perceptible effect it has on people around you. The pale, soft-focus blurriness of the florals merges so completely with the pheromones of your own skin that people hugging you will pull you a little tighter, entranced by what they think is your natural smell. It is an intimate, soft scent, the foggy musk and pale spring flowers all working together to form a muted color palette against which your own personality sparkles like a diamond. Beautiful work."," Lilac, wisteria, hawthorn",totally white capture ethereal foggy dew spring morning parisian city park smell like field wildflower wake en masse delicate slightly honey scent lilac wisteria mingle intoxicatingly bitter leathery scent hawthorn bush create effect pollenrich waterycool would forgive early morning joggers look dazed slightly drunk fragrance whose subtlety may make forget wear perceptible effect people around pale softfocus blurriness floral merge completely pheromone skin people hug pull little tight entrance think natural smell intimate soft scent foggy musk pale spring flower work together form muted color palette personality sparkle like diamond beautiful work
cedar woodpecker eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," The amusingly-named Cedar Woodpecker is a spicy, citrusy cedar fragrance with impeccable taste and noble lineage. At once robust and refined, the rich Virginian cedarwood forms the glowing brown heart of the fragrance, displaying a stoutness of character you just know you can rely on. On top, a turbo-charged cedrat fizzes and snaps like a cable wire loose in a storm  this note is exciting and has movement, charging the sturdy cedar underneath with electricity. The contrast between the sourness of that green citrus and the warmth of the cedar is both exhilarating and comfortable. It just works. A dove-grey iris in the base is a fluffy pillow on which the cedar finally rests his grizzled, noble old head. The faint hint of powdery florals doesn't detract from the muscular, essentially woody, masculine character of the scent, but rather add a velvety softness that soothes and calms. The iris also introduces the faint echo of Guerlainade: lovers of the classic Habit Rouge might want to check out its more modern, stripped-down, and rugged younger brother. In an age when men are short-changed on good masculines, Cedar Woodpecker comes as a welcome surprise."," Cedar, citrus, iris",amusinglyname cedar woodpecker spicy citrusy cedar fragrance impeccable taste noble lineage robust refined rich virginian cedarwood form glow brown heart fragrance display stoutness character know rely top turbocharge cedrat fizz snap like cable wire loose storm note exciting movement charge sturdy cedar underneath electricity contrast sourness green citrus warmth cedar exhilarate comfortable work dovegrey iris base fluffy pillow cedar finally rest grizzle noble old head faint hint powdery floral not detract muscular essentially woody masculine character scent rather add velvety softness soothes calms iris also introduce faint echo guerlainade lover classic habit rouge may want check modern strippeddown rugged young brother age man shortchanged good masculine cedar woodpecker come welcome surprise
milky musk eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," In the late 1990's and under the direction of Tom Ford, Michel Almairac created one of the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century: Gucci Rush. A massive lactonic peach with a voice like a foghorn, it wore like the tightest, shiniest red vinyl dress ever created. Now twenty years later, Michel picks up the reins again to create a softer, muskier version that explores the same theme of milk and fruit, but this time with an indoors voice. Milky Musk first melts a leafy-green, coconutty fig down into a pool of warm, creamy sandalwood and wraps it all in a cloudy, milky musk that feels like cashmere. Soft and vaporous, it shifts around the body like a second skin as the wearer moves. Over time, the musk parts to reveal the bitterness of fruit skin, giving the creamy lactones an adult bite. Imagine a slimmed-down Rush, grown soft and husky with age, and you're in the right ballpark. It's adorable."," Sandalwood, musk, fig",late 1990s direction tom ford michel almairac create one iconic perfumes 20th century gucci rush massive lactonic peach voice like foghorn wear like tightest shiniest red vinyl dress ever create twenty year later michel pick rein create soft muskier version explore theme milk fruit time indoor voice milky musk first melt leafygreen coconutty fig pool warm creamy sandalwood wraps cloudy milky musk feel like cashmere soft vaporous shift around body like second skin wearer move time musk part reveal bitterness fruit skin give creamy lactone adult bite imagine slimmeddown rush grow soft husky age right ballpark adorable
tomboy neroli eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Tomboy Neroli is a paradox: sexy and clean. It smells like a freshly-laundered cotton t-shirt stripped off a hot, young body that has been wearing a classic eau de cologne all day. Male or female? Doesn't matter. When it's this good, it's for everyone.  The crisp greenness of neroli up top is as refreshing as drenching oneself in eau de cologne straight from the fridge on a hot day. As it melts into the waxy orange blossom notes underneath, the neroli loses its freshness and becomes subsumed by the honeyed warmth of the white floral. All of this draped over a smoky woody amber that gives you the chemical high of a good white musk. The equivalent of the perfect white t-shirt, this one's for sexy tomboys everywhere."," Neroli, orange blossom, amber",tomboy neroli paradox sexy clean smell like freshlylaundered cotton tshirt strip hot young body wear classic eau de cologne day male female not matter good everyone crisp greenness neroli top refreshing drench oneself eau de cologne straight fridge hot day melt waxy orange blossom note underneath neroli lose freshness become subsumed honey warmth white floral drape smoky woody amber give chemical high good white musk equivalent perfect white tshirt one sexy tomboy everywhere
woody perfecto eau de parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum," Woody Perfecto is a seemingly simple mix of coffee, vetiver, and leather, but there is something so nailed about this fragrance that it's hard to keep a grin off our face. Coffee is a difficult note to pull off; in Woody Perfecto, you get a perfectly dark, roasted bean with no off notes or milkiness to distract from the main event. Just damn fine coffee, as Agent Cooper would say.   With a smoky vetiver and a touch of black, worn leather, we have no difficulty grasping the vision of the scent's creators here when they talk about living in the shoes of a rock star. Wearing this, we are suddenly drinking black coffee, watching the roadies rigging the sound equipment, breathing in the smell of warm, trampled grass, cigarette smoke, and the warm bodies of excited fans pressing close. Dark and straightforwardly masculine, this is what you wear when anticipation is a shape in the air."," Coffee, vetiver, leather",woody perfecto seemingly simple mix coffee vetiver leather something nail fragrance hard keep grin face coffee difficult note pull woody perfecto get perfectly dark roast bean no note milkiness distract main event damn fine coffee agent cooper would say smoky vetiver touch black wear leather no difficulty grasping vision scent creator talk live shoe rock star wear suddenly drinking black coffee watch roadie rig sound equipment breathing smell warm trample grass cigarette smoke warm body excited fan press close dark straightforwardly masculine wear anticipation shape air
satori eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," For her house's signature scent,  Satori Osawa needed the perfect fusion of French and Japanese materials,  techniques,  and aesthetics,  and yet her inspiration came from a precious ingredient derived from somewhere else entirely- Middle Eastern agarwood,  or oud. And yet,  the choice is perfect,  as agarwood exemplifies the Japanese concept of ""five tastes, "" exhibiting spicy,  bitter,  sweet,  sour and salty facets all at once. A fragrance that fully encapsulates all five of these elements,  Satori features a carefully selected suite of notes meant to complement each,  with cinnamon and clove enhancing the spicy,  cacao the bitter,  vanilla the sweet,  and bitter orange,  oak moss and cypress for the sour and salty. Blended over a smooth,  woody bed of sandalwood and frankincense,  eastern and western elements converge with sublime balance,  creating a gentle,  warm and enveloping atmosphere. In this way,  Satori is ultimately a fragrance that is universal but delightfully specific,  where Japanese concepts become a global philosophy- elegant,  romantic and enchanting."," Bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, agarwood (oud)",house signature scent satori osawa need perfect fusion french japanese material technique aesthetic yet inspiration come precious ingredient derive somewhere else entirely middle eastern agarwood oud yet choice perfect agarwood exemplifie japanese concept five taste exhibit spicy bitter sweet sour salty facet fragrance fully encapsulates five element satori feature carefully select suite note mean complement cinnamon clove enhance spicy cacao bitter vanilla sweet bitter orange oak moss cypress sour salty blend smooth woody bed sandalwood frankincense eastern western element converge sublime balance create gentle warm envelop atmosphere way satori ultimately fragrance universal delightfully specific japanese concept become global philosophy elegant romantic enchanting
iris homme eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," The traditional arts of Japan are permeated with a dedication to simplicity- the idea that the more diligently and deliberately a flower is placed, or a brushstroke applied, the more significant it becomes. As a guiding principle for perfumery, it represents a departure from the operatic construction of European classics, and it is this principle that makes Iris Homme a deeply distinguished masculine of powerful subtlety. Iris Homme opens with bright, clarifying citrus, an authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast with an undercurrent of spicy cardamom that leads into the dry floral heart. The iris in question recalls MPG's classic Iris Bleu Gris in its clean, robust take on the note, but here the naturalism is slightly more incorporated, as an earthy violet and jasmine combination lingers softly but noticeably in the background. A warmly accessible base of ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple and long-lasting character, making this an ideal fragrance for situations formal and informal alike. Simplicity, after all, leaves ample room for interpretation."," Lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk",traditional art japan permeate dedication simplicity idea diligently deliberately flower place brushstroke apply significant become guide principle perfumery represent departure operatic construction european classic principle make iris homme deeply distinguished masculine powerful subtlety iris homme open bright clarify citrus authentically juicy lemon give masculine contrast undercurrent spicy cardamom lead dry floral heart iris question recall mpgs classic iris bleu gris clean robust take note naturalism slightly incorporated earthy violet jasmine combination linger softly noticeably background warmly accessible base ambere sandalwood provide appropriately simple longlaste character make ideal fragrance situation formal informal alike simplicity leave ample room interpretation
hana hiraku eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," The Oriental category of perfumes has long been embellished by Western perfumers,  constructing olfactory fantasies as seen from the outside. With Hana Hiraku,  Satori Osawa deconstructs the Oriental,  departing from what she calls the westernizedglossy note and,  as a Japanese perfumer,  creates a new category that she calls aDry Oriental, "" defined by a more matte quality. In Hana Hiraku (orA Flower Blooms),  earthy,  savory notes of miso and mitarashi,  or sweet soy sauce,  replace the animalic notes present in more Middle Eastern-style Oriental perfumes. The sensual,  intoxicating quality of Oriental perfumery transforms into coolly understated je-ne-sais-quoi,  like a romantic at arm's length.  Hana Hiraku blooms first with a sweet,  creamy musk melon,  freshly cut with a salted knife. The honeydew is soft but prominent,  and lifts up pale,  watery magnolia flowers in all their green and aquatic glory. Quite distinctive is the addition of Japanese miso,  which lends its uniquely briny,  earthy umami quality to ground the floating magnolia. This union is actually not unusual in Japanese cuisine,  where the large leaves of the magnolia tree are used as plates or for wrapping and baking miso or mochi rice cakes. This harmonious relationship reaches new heights with the sustained soft-focus cream of the melon,  and achieves a sublime sensuality for the senses. This is no dripping or heavy scent,  but rather it is perfume as seen through a frosted glass  diffuse,  tender,  and delicately blurred."," Melon, bergamot, galbanum, magnolia, iris, jasmine, tuberose, rose, ylang ylang, chamomile, miso, kogashi-shoyu, beeswax, sandalwood, cedarwood",oriental category perfumes long embellish western perfumer construct olfactory fantasy see outside hana hiraku satori osawa deconstruct oriental depart call westernizedglossy note japanese perfumer create new category call adry oriental define matte quality hana hiraku ora flower blooms earthy savory note miso mitarashi sweet soy sauce replace animalic note present middle easternstyle oriental perfumes sensual intoxicate quality oriental perfumery transform coolly understate jenesaisquoi like romantic arm length hana hiraku blooms first sweet creamy musk melon freshly cut salt knife honeydew soft prominent lift pale watery magnolia flower green aquatic glory quite distinctive addition japanese miso lend uniquely briny earthy umami quality ground float magnolia union actually not unusual japanese cuisine large leave magnolia tree use plate wrapping baking miso mochi rice cake harmonious relationship reach new heights sustained softfocus cream melon achieve sublime sensuality sense no drip heavy scent rather perfume see frost glass diffuse tender delicately blur
wasanbon eau de parfum,Parfum Satori," Wasanbon is an intricate puzzle veiled in beguiling charm. Evoking Japanese tea-time, Wasanbon is a type of fine Japanese sugar hand-purified in multiple stages, used to make the highest class of delicate sugar candy. Perfumer Satori Osawa was tickled by its homonym in French,Wa sent bon meaningWa smells good  Wa being the Japanese word for social harmony. Unlike the typical scent imagined from the concept of Wa, Wasanbon is mischievous, gliding into any situation with its sparkling confectionary charm, but slowly revealing the elegant, refined heart within. A tart, tangy lemon opens the fragrance, immediately uplifting, giddy on clouds. Not only is it sprinkled with crystalline sugar, but rounded out with juicy muscat grape, tart and sweet. These immediate fruits give way to a most delicate, pillowy mÃ©lange of lightly honeyed mimosa flower, lily-of-the-valley, and the body of the fragrance, an exquisite wasanbon sugar, finely purified and crushed, sieved into the finest powder. A dusting of almond and vanilla only add to the heavenly delight of the senses. As the candy dissolves away, Wasanbon remains light and airy, lifted with an exquisite iris and soft, velvety guaiacwood.

io non ho mani che mi accarezzino il volto extrait de parfum,UNUM," Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto - ""There are no hands / to caress my face."" This is the beginning of a 1948 poem by Father David Maria Turoldo, which the Italian photographer Mario Giacomelli took as the name for a photography series in the early 1960s. It's these photos that serve as the inspiration for UNUM's founder and artist Filippo Sorcinelli's new fragrance. The photos are striking: disarming images of young priests in states of joyous movement, dancing and playing. The fragrance is an olfactory rendering of the stunning imagery, capturing the humanity beneath the black cassocks.  The fragrance opens with a fizzy glow of crackling petitgrain and bergamot, which lifts up to reveal the heart: a breathtaking wall of scent, flawlessly blended cedar with spice, like cinnamon, and clary sage, ylang ylang, and resins. The drydown evokes what we imagine the seminary could have been, its stone walled building resonating with sandalwood, rituals cloaked in incense and benzoin, and the warm puff of tobacco. It transports you into Giacomelli's photographs of the clergymen smoking cigars - when the rector saw these images, it was the last straw, and Giacomelli was prevented from ever photographing at the seminary again."," Petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood",io non ho mani che mi accarezzino il volto no hand caress face begin 1948 poem father david maria turoldo italian photographer mario giacomelli take name photography series early 1960s photo serve inspiration unum founder artist filippo sorcinellis new fragrance photo strike disarm image young priest state joyous movement dance play fragrance olfactory rendering stunning imagery capture humanity beneath black cassock fragrance open fizzy glow crackle petitgrain bergamot lift reveal heart breathtake wall scent flawlessly blend cedar spice like cinnamon clary sage ylang ylang resin drydown evoke imagine seminary could stone wall build resonate sandalwood ritual cloak incense benzoin warm puff tobacco transport giacomellis photograph clergymen smoking cigars rector see image last straw giacomelli prevent ever photograph seminary
black phantom eau de parfum,By Kilian," Through a glass, darkly. Black Phantom is a unisex woody gourmand that will please just about everyone. Its topnotes have a dangerous glitter to them, like a glass of rum rimmed in cane sugar set alight, sending sparks of roasted nuts, caramel, booze, and smoke out into the night air. Once the boozy fireflies have dimmed a little, a gentler accord begins to bloom  a wonderfully soft, nutty sandalwood that reminds us of caramelized pain de mie dipped into warm milk. But despite all the foodie notes, Black Phantom is not thick or heavy. Shot through with wisps of woodsmoke, resin, and roasted coffee, Black Phantom is clearly a gourmand aimed at more adult tastes. Imagine a cozy Parisian cafÃ© on a cold, rainy day. You are reading a book and sipping a milky coffee with a drop of rum on the side to warm your bones. Delicious aromas of pralines, fresh pastries, chocolate, toasted nuts, and coffee melt waft over the papery vanilla smell of your book and the bitter almond posies of heliotrope on each table. Now imagine the undertow of a really good sandalwood that smells like salty butter and sweet cream.

Here, the debate between the rational and the spiritual plays out in Bugey's choice of ingredients, with the natural world represented first via a rich, gently earthy incense, the most fundamental of all perfume ingredients, recalling ancient devotionals and primal understandings. Then, the scientific comes into focus, combining the comforting cleanness of Ambrox with Vulcanolide, a cutting edge synthetic musk with earthy and amber facets. The result is a fragrance that wears lightly, but not weakly- there's an elemental power beneath the surface, humming with clean energy, but also just enough earthiness to never fully leave the natural realm. Part rational, part spiritual, Mirabilis is a true reconciliation between reason and belief.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Ambrox, incense, white musk vulcanolide",elegant simplicity mirabilis natura fabularis collection perfumer daphne bugey attempt tackle one mans deep question nature vs science clever fragrant twist debate rational spiritual play bugey choice ingredient natural world represent first via rich gently earthy incense fundamental perfume ingredient recall ancient devotional primal understanding scientific come focus combine comfort cleanness ambrox vulcanolide cut edge synthetic musk earthy amber facet result fragrance wear lightly not weakly elemental power beneath surface hum clean energy also enough earthiness never fully leave natural realm part rational part spiritual mirabilis true reconciliation reason belief natura fabularis fragrance present exquisite glass atomizer flacon beautiful metal bee detail
arcana rosa eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," There's no shortage of pithy phrases involving roses and thorns, but you'd never know it by smelling the bland softness of most mass market rose fragrances. Luckily, Arcana Rosa's thorns are front and center, hardened over an open cedar fire and spiked with rooty vetiver and prickly cade. Through the smoke, a lush, beautifully full bodied Bulgarian rose still asserts its beauty, but the woods and resins transmute its strength into something of awe and danger, a rose equally at home on a man or woman. We're not surprised that the Natura Fabularis collection needed a rose. We're simply grateful that they decided that they decided that the same old rose just wouldn't do.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Rose, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, cade, labdanum",no shortage pithy phrase involve rose thorn would never know smell bland softness mass market rise fragrance luckily arcana rosas thorn front center harden open cedar fire spike rooty vetiver prickly cade smoke lush beautifully full bodied bulgarian rise still assert beauty wood resin transmute strength something awe danger rise equally home man woman not surprised natura fabularis collection need rise simply grateful decide decide old rise would not natura fabularis fragrance present exquisite glass atomizer flacon beautiful metal bee detail
tenebrae eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Tenebrae, as the official text from the Natura Fabularis collection describes it, is the scent of a ""dark and shadowy forest"" so overgrown that light barely peeks through the treetops, and we certainly wouldn't disagree. But in true fairy tale fashion, this forest hides not only mysterious dangers, represented with dark resins and woods, but also mystical wonders, in the form of a marvelously sweet and complex crystallized sap note that combines with a not-too-heavy dose of incense. The result is a fragrance that lifts us upwards, letting us know that the sun is still there, even if we can't quite see it.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Incense, resin, sap",tenebrae official text natura fabularis collection describe scent dark shadowy forest overgrow light barely peeks treetop certainly would not disagree true fairy tale fashion forest hides not mysterious danger represent dark resin wood also mystical wonder form marvelously sweet complex crystallized sap note combine nottooheavy dose incense result fragrance lift us upwards let us know sun still even not quite see natura fabularis fragrance present exquisite glass atomizer flacon beautiful metal bee detail
violaceum eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," It takes all of a second for the beauty of a flower to topple over in the darkness. Composed for L'Artisan Parfumeur's exclusive collection, Natura Fabularis, Violaceum pays tribute to the ephemeral character of nature. In the shade of a forest lies a carpet of violets. Despite their delicate nature, these flowers are not prone to sentimentality. The usually powdery sensation is replaced by an impression of leather. The perfumer, DaphnÃ© Bugey, creates confusion and depth by combining the violet, cousin of the iris, to an accord of carrot and saffron. A simple flower can no longer be perceived, and instead, a complex and poetic blend comes together, where gastronomy and the floral arts meet in two distinct new accords: carrot-saffron and leathery-violet. As Violaceum deepens on the skin, it resonates with poetic clarity- classic and contemporary all at once.Each Natura Fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," Carrot, saffron, leather, violet",take second beauty flower topple darkness compose lartisan parfumeur exclusive collection natura fabularis violaceum pays tribute ephemeral character nature shade forest lie carpet violet despite delicate nature flower not prone sentimentality usually powdery sensation replace impression leather perfumer daphna bugey create confusion depth combine violet cousin iris accord carrot saffron simple flower no long perceive instead complex poetic blend come together gastronomy floral art meet two distinct new accord carrotsaffron leatheryviolet violaceum deepen skin resonate poetic clarity classic contemporary natura fabularis fragrance present exquisite glass atomizer flacon beautiful metal bee detail

feu secret eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Of the four grades of fire with which the ancient alchemists worked,  the primary one for the true alchemist was the Secret Fire  the fire that was able to affect matter without having a physical presence itself.  It is theserpentine working power in the body,  the electro-spiritual,  creative life force of the alchemist himself.  The acclaimed artist-perfumer Bruno Fazzolari has brought the secret fire to life in this shape-shifting ode to the orris root. Feu Secret opens with a bright-cold burst of pink pepper and eucalyptus that lifts the orris root to the sun,  almost mimicking a citrus note. This is no earthy-cold iris  if anything,  the spices bring out the hidden warmth of the orris butter,  melting into the skin. The transformative nature of the iris comes out in the heart,  not lipstick-violet in any mortal way,  but ethereally smoky,  reaching its roots into the earth. Reducing all other attempts at rooty orris to mere sweet carrots,  rising tendrils of birch tar smoke give way to a gauzy,  woody veil,  enthroned in vanilla and cedar. The vibrant life energy is properly interpreted here,  by turns airy,  fiery,  and earthy on the skin.  As a divine incantation,  Feu Secret is surprisingly androgynous and sublimely distinctive."," Hemlock spruce, eucalyptus, iris, turmeric, pink pepper, Himalayan cedar, birch tar, vanilla",four grade fire ancient alchemists work primary one true alchemist secret fire fire able affect matter without physical presence theserpentine work power body electrospiritual creative life force alchemist acclaim artistperfumer bruno fazzolari bring secret fire life shapeshifte ode orris root feu secret open brightcold burst pink pepper eucalyptus lift orris root sun almost mimicking citrus note no earthycold iris anything spice bring hide warmth orris butter melt skin transformative nature iris come heart not lipstickviolet mortal way ethereally smoky reach root earth reduce attempt rooty orris mere sweet carrot rise tendril birch tar smoke give way gauzy woody veil enthrone vanilla cedar vibrant life energy properly interpret turn airy fiery earthy skin divine incantation feu secret surprisingly androgynous sublimely distinctive

cypress shade eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," More shade than cypress, Cypress Shade is so astonishingly good at capturing the cool, herbal dampness of the ground under a cypress tree that you might want to curl up and take a little nap. Take a good book with you, and a glass of ice-cold Pastis.The mastic woodiness of the cypress does not dominate, forming instead a softly green, balsamic curtain through which the other notes shine. Fresh mint, vetiver, and coriander form a cooling mat of aromatic grasses that is as welcome on a hot day as a cool cloth on the forehead. The unmistakable licorice snap of anise darts and weaves through the damp green notes, turning the mind most pleasurably to the midday aperitif. But what elevates this scent beyond the standard woody aromatic is the mimosa, a powdery yellow flower that smells like almond flour, glue, cucumber, and innocence itself. The mimosa sparkles before folding itself into a vigorous base of Madagascaran cedar and Haitian vetiver. It ends, as all things should, in the milky, anise-tinted blur of Pastis."," Lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud",shade cypress cypress shade astonishingly good capture cool herbal dampness ground cypress tree may want curl take little nap take good book glass icecold pastis mastic woodiness cypress not dominate form instead softly green balsamic curtain note shine fresh mint vetiver coriander form cool mat aromatic grass welcome hot day cool cloth forehead unmistakable licorice snap anise dart weave damp green note turn mind pleasurably midday aperitif elevate scent beyond standard woody aromatic mimosa powdery yellow flower smell like almond flour glue cucumber innocence mimosa sparkle fold vigorous base madagascaran cedar haitian vetiver ends thing milky anisetinte blur pastis
dates delight eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Are you the kind of person who looks at the dessert list before choosing the appetizers? Well, then welcome to the most sumptuous dessert trolley you've ever set eyes on  Dates Delight. Imagine a gold dish piled high with sticky RiyÃ  dates as plump as a baby's fist and dripping with raw honey and caramel. Now picture them dunked into a bath of the silkiest crÃ¨me brulee, thick with vanilla bean underneath and crackling with melted brown sugar on top. Visualize all this dusted with a thick layer of spicy cinnamon. Are you salivating yet? Thankfully, although this scent is delicious it stops short of total gluttony because of the inedible elements at play. So while the honey and dates may make your mouth water, the coumarin, with its nuances of warm, pungent hay, bitter almonds, and tobacco makes you hesitate to put it in your mouth. Benzoin and labdanum add smoke, leather, and a hint of tar that reins it in even further. Even the soapy little peony note up top whispers, don't eat me. It's this level of abstraction that balances the scent, and renders it sophisticated. Fans of Oajan by Parfums de Marly and Ambre Narguile by Hermes will feel right at home here."," Peony, dates, coumarin, caramel, tonka, cinnamon, honey, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla, sugar",kind person look dessert list choose appetizer well welcome sumptuous dessert trolley ever set eye date delight imagine gold dish pile high sticky riya date plump babys fist drip raw honey caramel picture dunk bath silkiest cra brulee thick vanilla bean underneath crackle melt brown sugar top visualize dust thick layer spicy cinnamon salivate yet thankfully although scent delicious stop short total gluttony inedible element play honey date may make mouth water coumarin nuance warm pungent hay bitter almond tobacco make hesitate put mouth benzoin labdanum add smoke leather hint tar rein even even soapy little peony note top whisper not eat level abstraction balance scent render sophisticated fan oajan parfum de marly ambre narguile hermes feel right home
golden powder eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Although strictly speaking the name Golden Powder refers to a meditation technique that opens up the chest to rays of chakra-cleansing light, we kind of prefer to think that the name really is a sly nod to those famousgolden dust attars for which the Middle East and India are famous  beautifully warm, resinous ambers with nuances of tobacco, cinnamon, and vanilla-soaked wood.Golden Powder is a luxury rendition of this oriental theme, taking it to a richer, more refined level. The first impression is of dry woods, flurries of dusty cinnamon and nutmeg swirling around tough Virginian cedar and robust tobacco leaf. But then a cinnamon-apple amber and golden vanilla swells up from underneath, folding the woods, tobacco, and spice into a room-filling crescendo of creamy sweetness. Oriental, yes, but as user-friendly as a Golden Retriever. Fans of Kalemat and Raghba looking for an upgrade may want to try this on for size."," Nutmeg, cinnamon, sandalwood, guaiac wood, cedar, papyrus, musk, labdanum, vanilla, coumarin, tobacco blossom",although strictly speak name golden powder refer meditation technique open chest ray chakracleansing light kind prefer think name really sly nod famousgolden dust attars middle east india famous beautifully warm resinous amber nuance tobacco cinnamon vanillasoake wood golden powder luxury rendition oriental theme take rich refined level first impression dry wood flurry dusty cinnamon nutmeg swirl around tough virginian cedar robust tobacco leaf cinnamonapple amber golden vanilla swells underneath fold wood tobacco spice roomfille crescendo creamy sweetness oriental yes userfriendly golden retriever fan kalemat raghba look upgrade may want try size

A stunningfall harvest fragrance, Grape Pearls strikes a perfect balance between the honeyed freshness of flowers and the earthier smells of the land as it gives up its yield. The opening notes of fruit and red wine transport us to the packing shed, where the crates of freshly-picked grapes are stacked one on top of another. These smell of ripe grapes and red berries, but also of wine must, honey, and old wood - olfactory memories of the harvests of yesteryear. Then we are transported outside, to the orchard, among wicker baskets overflowing with blueberries and deep, blowsy roses. A waft of freshly roasted coffee beans snakes through the vines and mingles with the fruit and flowers, bringing with it the promise of a rest. Hot coffee taken in companionable silence with one's fellow workers, surrounded by the smells of the harvest, and all wrapped up in a silky amber and vanilla accord that feels like a soft bed after a long day.

almond harmony eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by the early blossoms of the almond tree, which signify resurrection and the dawning of life, Almond Harmony is a beautifully constructed floral oriental that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit.

blessing silence eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," The age-old pairing of rose, oud, and patchouli....you might have heard this tune before, but when it's done as right as Blessing Silence, it's as revelatory as listening to a Justin Bieber tune sung by Placido Domingo. Good materials make all the difference. Right out of the gate, you notice the tight balance between four big power players  the deeply tarry, leathery labdanum, the burning oud chip note, the beefy rose, and the pungent patchouli. The powerful notes try at first to duke it out, each hoping to emerge as alpha dog, but in the end, they call a truce. What emerges from the tussle is an incredibly rich, oozing animalic accord of earth, rot, smoke, rose, leather, and resin. It's an aroma as ancient as perfume itself, a word which, after all, meansthrough the smoke. One sniff of this heavenly potion and you will be whisked away to a Sultan's palace where they are fumigating his robes and rooms with Kyara from the jungles of Vietnam.

breath of the infinite eau de parfum,The House Of Oud," Inspired by that tremulous moment when our world first came to be, Breath of the Infinite is an attempt to capture in fragrance form the smell of space particles and stars colliding in an explosion so colossal that it makes the universe contract and hold its breath. The fragrance itself is as cloudy and as abstract as the aftermath.It's not an easy one to describe. A mixture of peppery, raw ambroxan and woody musk forms a nebulous background against which tiny starbursts of peony and freesia pop like soap bubbles. It feels both as spare and modern as a Giacometti sculpture, and as ancient as a piece of driftwood on the beach. Black pepper, metal, dust, salt, wood, and the sensuous, latex-like slip of cashmeran in the base  as elemental as time itself. If you love scents like L'Antimatiere that keep you guessing, then head on over to the ultra-mysterious Breath of the Infinite."," Peony, freesia, peach, musk, ambroxan, cashmeran, oud",inspire tremulous moment world first come breath infinite attempt capture fragrance form smell space particle star collide explosion colossal make universe contract hold breath fragrance cloudy abstract aftermath not easy one describe mixture peppery raw ambroxan woody musk form nebulous background tiny starbursts peony freesia pop like soap bubble feel spare modern giacometti sculpture ancient piece driftwood beach black pepper metal dust salt wood sensuous latexlike slip cashmeran base elemental time love scent like lantimatiere keep guess head ultramysterious breath infinite
clandestine clara eau de parfum,Penhaligons," Rebellious, contradictory, independent, unconventional- these are the words Penhaligon's uses to describe Clara, the latest character in their Portraits saga- the illicit mistress to Lord George. And true to form, Clara's fragrance could be described much the same way, as a boozy, smoky, smoothly woodsy feminine scent that's not for the faint of heart, but is sure to command the attention of sophisticated thrill-seekers. Spicy and sweet in equal measure, Clandestine Clara layered rich, smooth rhum vanilla over musky cinnamon, creating a true gourmand that nonetheless never feels simple, dessert-y or girlish- due, perhaps, to the complex ambered patchouli in the base. Is Clandestine Clara a challenging fragrance? We'd have to say so- but as Lord George can confirm, it's a challenge bound to seduce."," Rhum vanilla, cinnamon musk, amber, patchouli",rebellious contradictory independent unconventional word penhaligon use describe clara late character portrait saga illicit mistress lord george true form clara fragrance could describe much way boozy smoky smoothly woodsy feminine scent not faint heart sure command attention sophisticated thrillseeker spicy sweet equal measure clandestine clara layered rich smooth rhum vanilla musky cinnamon create true gourmand nonetheless never feel simple desserty girlish due perhaps complex ambere patchouli base clandestine clara challenge fragrance would say lord george confirm challenge bound seduce

durga eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," What does floral nirvana feel like?

rhinoceros extrait de parfum,Zoologist," Across the savanna, in the dry heat of midday, aromas of parched grasses and campfire woods crackle in the arid air. A stir of something densely animalic causes nearby sandpipers to lift their heads in alarm. The rhino lowers his head, and smaller creatures scatter.Rhinoceros is an animalic fougere that charges in headfirst with uncompromisingly butch notes of tannic leather and rum.  But this rough beast hides a gentlemanly heart.  The rough, raw leather of the opening is gradually smoothed out by herbal-tonic notes of lavender, sage and geranium.

macaque eau de parfum,Zoologist," Macaque, that most playful of primates, starts with a bit of mischief. Tangy, off-sweet mandarin and green apple run smack into a startlingly vibrant galbanum that picks them up and shakes them by the scruff. But before the galbanum can get the upper hand, the fruit is bolstered by grassy green and jasmine teas and a rather serious cedar, which calms the bite of the galbanum.  At this stage, Macaque seems to be an on its way to becoming an eccentrically fetching green perfume. But what happens next makes Macaque a true original.The vivid fruit and green notes spread out, becoming less opaque, as ceremonial aromas of smoky incense and oud start to rise. Macaque transforms from impish volley between tree fruit and vegetation to a dialogue between the contemplative and spiritual and the primal. In the dry-down, mossy and woody aromas meld with the bright notes of Macaque's opening, creating an interplay of wildness and meditative that is as provocative as it is soothing."," Cedar, green apple, red mandarin, frankincense, galbanum, honey, rosewood, ylang, jasmine tea, cedarmoss, green tea, white oud, musk",macaque playful primate start bit mischief tangy offsweet mandarin green apple run smack startlingly vibrant galbanum pick shake scruff galbanum get upper hand fruit bolster grassy green jasmine teas rather serious cedar calms bite galbanum stage macaque seem way become eccentrically fetch green perfume happen next make macaque true original vivid fruit green note spread become less opaque ceremonial aromas smoky incense oud start rise macaque transform impish volley tree fruit vegetation dialogue contemplative spiritual primal drydown mossy woody aromas meld bright note macaques opening create interplay wildness meditative provocative soothe

It had been designed for a princess.  Spiritual and multilingual, Kismet cultivated the mystery surrounding her background.

bass solo eau de parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Inspired by Wendge, the beautifully dark-grained African wood whose dense timber makes it coveted for the crafting of musical instruments, Bass Solo, the newest scent from The Vagabond Prince, is truly a virtuosic work. While Wenge doesn't have an aroma of its own, its combination of beauty and function inspired master perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour to fashion a fragrance that itself extracts deep and vibrant accords hidden within its notes. Like the profound resonance of the titular instrument, Bass Solo offers an aroma pitched in the lowest register, its dense melody composed of a selection of exquisite woody notes including soft sandalwood, salty driftwood, and a blend of cedars with warm, comfortable, dry nuances.

11 eau de parfum,Boris Bidjan Saberi," Boris Bidjan Saberi has never been known for conservatism- his edgy, modern designs and provocative collections have raised eyebrows and thrilled fashion-lovers, all while maintaining an exceptional level of detail-oriented artisanal craftsmanship. So it's only fitting that for his debut fragrance 11, Saberi, in collaboration with Geza Schoen, has created a vibrant, stylish scent bursting with creativity. Inspired by Saberi's leatherwork studio, where he hand-constructs intricate horse leather jackets, this scent reflects the care, personality, and style that Boris imprints into every item he produces. While it might seem like this would result in a heavy, challengingly industrial fragrance, Geza Schoen has instead crafted a dynamically casual, everyday leather scent that we find surprisingly soft and fresh. An initial whiff of freshly cut grass slowly dissipates into something more craftsmanlike, a smooth, supple but substantial leather with hints of wax and glue to give it a playful and creative character. 11 wears with easygoing unisex modernity, masculine and refined on a man, chic and sexy on a woman.

sheiduna parfum extrait,Puredistance," Shei-du-na. Enunciate each syllable and all the right associations come to mind: she, sheikh, dunes. In his 1992 novel The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje mentions that sand dunes in the Sahara resemble the dips and hollows of a woman's back. Sheiduna perfectly captures that sense of duality between two things that look the same and yet are not the same  the shadowed softness of a woman's hip and the dusty angularity of a wind-sharpened dune. The opening is a plume of smoke and tangerine peel set inside a golden, radiant cloud of resins that swirls around the wearer like a sand storm. Out of this expansive blur of sparkling particles emerges a spicy clove note that gives the fragrance a subtle vintage Opium hue. A rich rose weaves in and out of this fuzzy haze of amber and spices, like the orange-red glow of lighthouse in thick fog. It's this seamless shifting between dry, spicy radiance and soft, sweet florals and vanilla that makes Sheiduna so interesting  and so difficult to define. We'd sum it up by saying it's like breathing in the arid air of the desert while nuzzling the neck of an exotically perfumed woman."," Lemon, tangerine, blackcurrant, aldehydes, Bulgarian rose essence, geranium, clove, vetiver, patchouly, woody amber, incense, benzoin, myrrh, tonka bean, vanilla pods, musks",sheiduna enunciate syllable right association come mind sheikh dune 1992 novel english patient michael ondaatje mention sand dune sahara resemble dip hollow womans back sheiduna perfectly capture sense duality two thing look yet not shadowed softness womans hip dusty angularity windsharpene dune opening plume smoke tangerine peel set inside golden radiant cloud resin swirls around wearer like sand storm expansive blur sparkle particle emerge spicy clove note give fragrance subtle vintage opium hue rich rise weave fuzzy haze amber spice like orangere glow lighthouse thick fog seamless shift dry spicy radiance soft sweet floral vanilla make sheiduna interesting difficult define would sum say like breathing arid air desert nuzzle neck exotically perfumed woman

Imagine a thick stew of chocolatey spices fermenting in an oak barrel, and a man pouring in handfuls of dry tobacco leaves and oud wood chips, dark with resin. After a long soak, the drenched woods and tobacco leaves are spread out to bake under a hot sun, releasing a host of fruited, dark, fermented aromas. One doesn't know where the oud begins and the tobacco ends.The genius of this scent is that the perfumer knows how to pull all the chaotic, disparate elements of the scent into one harmonious whole, using a smooth, earthy myrrh to link the fungal dampness of the oud to the creamy sweetness of the tobacco leaf.

bapteme du feu eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," A proper carnival is full of light, noise, laughter, activity- and, ideally, that exhilarating sense of chaos that makes the world feel topsy-turvy and just the right amount of dangerous. Inspired by the funfairs of Serge Lutens' youth, Bapteme du Feu is a stroll through a gleefully disorienting boardwalk featuring the wonderfully discordant notes of sweet delights, animalic musk and the acerbic gunpowder of the carnival shooting range. As in previous Lutens creations, his favorite childhood treat of gingerbread plays a central role, but unlike the soft creaminess of Five O'Clock au Gingembre, the sweet ginger here is offset with the bitterness of burnt orange peel and galvanized with the striking, metallic tang of gunpowder. We suppose you could call it an avant-garde gourmand, but that somehow doesn't seem to encompass it fully. Perhaps the best we can say is that it is, as all of Serge Lutens' best works are, a portal into the unique world and vision of one of perfumery's truly independent voices."," Burnt orange peel, gunpowder, gingerbread, fresh ginger, cedar, incense, cinnamon, osmanthus, castoreum",proper carnival full light noise laughter activity ideally exhilarate sense chaos make world feel topsyturvy right amount dangerous inspire funfairs serge lutens youth bapteme du feu stroll gleefully disorient boardwalk feature wonderfully discordant note sweet delight animalic musk acerbic gunpowder carnival shoot range previous lutens creation favorite childhood treat gingerbread play central role unlike soft creaminess five clock au gingembre sweet ginger offset bitterness burn orange peel galvanized strike metallic tang gunpowder suppose could call avantgarde gourmand somehow not seem encompass fully perhaps good say serge lutens good work portal unique world vision one perfumerys truly independent voice

amber aoud extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," A Rolls Royce in a sea of Volkswagens, Roja Dove's Amber Aoud sets out to best every other rose-oud out there by sheer dint of superior raw materials and blending. Expensive this may be, but Roja Dove puts his money where his mouth is. Taking a regally sour, spicy Indian oud, he buries it deep within the folds of a jammy rose, and then tucks the whole thing into the pulpy insides of a Moroccan fig. Almost obscenely rich and opulent at first, it wears like the inside of a red velvet cloak lined in ermine. But look closely and you will see the artful balance between sweet and sour, dusty and moist, sharp and smooth. There is structure and discipline within the avalanche of richness. Birch tar and incense resins and gums provide a smoky fade-out that proves to be excellent ballast for the jammy sweetness up top. No wonder that many oud aficionados cite this as the best example of Western oud perfumery- a point we'd find hard to dispute."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, fig, jasmine, rose, ylang ylang, ambergris, aoud wood, birch, cinnamon, civet, musk, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood",roll royce sea volkswagens roja dove amber aoud set good every roseoud sheer dint superior raw material blending expensive may roja dove put money mouth take regally sour spicy indian oud burie deep within fold jammy rise tuck whole thing pulpy inside moroccan fig almost obscenely rich opulent first wear like inside red velvet cloak line ermine look closely see artful balance sweet sour dusty moist sharp smooth structure discipline within avalanche richness birch tar incense resin gums provide smoky fadeout prof excellent ballast jammy sweetness top no wonder many oud aficionados cite good example western oud perfumery point would find hard dispute
musk aoud extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," Imagine a courtly banquet hall, its walls hung with massive velvet tapestries, Irish wolfhounds lounging in fireplaces, heavy winter fur cloaks and sleeping animals strewn all around the stone floor. The High Priest lights his censer in a lull of conversation, and walks slowly through the hall, allowing thick plumes of smoke from fragrant incense resins and bitter dried herbs to circulate. Traders have brought a rare treasure for the King to look at  tiny shards of what they call oud wood. He burns a piece, and the air is suddenly pierced with a majestic aroma that comprises sour woodiness, smoke, rot, and a forest floor. This is what Musk Aoud smells like. All of this, all at once.Roja Dove's Musk Aoud is deeply, carnally suggestive. The musk is warm and suggestive of both animal and human fur. But what really rocks our boat is the current of smoky, oily sweetness running though the fragrance. The tensile weight here suggests centuries of smells packed in one on top of another, finally merging into one suggestive whole. We find it incredibly sexy. In fact, if we arrive at a bacchanalia and this scent isn't being pumped through the air ducts, then we're leaving."," Bergamot, lemon, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, ambrette, birch, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, precious woods, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",imagine courtly banquet hall wall hung massive velvet tapestry irish wolfhound lounge fireplace heavy winter fur cloaks sleep animal strew around stone floor high priest light censer lull conversation walk slowly hall allow thick plume smoke fragrant incense resin bitter dry herbs circulate trader bring rare treasure king look tiny shards call oud wood burns piece air suddenly pierce majestic aroma comprise sour woodiness smoke rot forest floor musk aoud smell like roja dove musk aoud deeply carnally suggestive musk warm suggestive animal human fur really rock boat current smoky oily sweetness run though fragrance tensile weight suggest century smell pack one top another finally merge one suggestive whole find incredibly sexy fact arrive bacchanalia scent not pump air duct leave
diaghilev extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," Mitsouko reupholstered in more expensive fabrics? Since it is named for Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes and someone who drenched the curtains in his bedroom and theatres with Mitsouko, it's tempting to think so. Insanely rich and opulent, Diaghilev takes the three pillars of the chypre  oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin  and wraps them up in a length of the dusty red velvet curtain that's been hanging in the OpÃ©ra National de Paris for over a century.But that's only part of the story. After all, who would pay such a high price for a remake of Mitsouko? Diaghilev stands head and shoulders above all other chypres for two reasons. First, the quality of the raw materials  think the smoothest oakmoss, the inkiest vetiver, the most exquisite ambrette seed, and finest floral absolutes  makes for an experience so intoxicating that you just stop questioning the cost. Second, Roja Dove has flushed the perfume with sensual musks, civet, resins, overripe fruit, and castoreum, loosening the stays on that uptight chypre structure and making it impossible to wear without thinking about sex. Bitter, rich, and complex, Diaghilev is the scent of old books, musty theatres, velvet curtains soaked in Mitsouko, and the sheen of salty, lickable, post-coital sweat on your lover's skin. Put smelling Diaghilev on your bucket list."," Bergamot, lemon, lime, orange, tarragon, blackcurrant buds, heliotrope, jasmine, peach, rose, tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, ambrette, benzoin, cedarwood, civet, clove, cumin, guaiacwood, labdanum, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, patchouli, peru balsam, sandalwood, styrax, vanilla, vetiver",mitsouko reupholstere expensive fabric since name sergei diaghilev founder ballet russe someone drench curtain bedroom theatre mitsouko tempting think insanely rich opulent diaghilev take three pillar chypre oakmoss bergamot labdanum resin wraps length dusty red velvet curtain hang opara national de paris century part story would pay high price remake mitsouko diaghilev stand head shoulder chypre two reason first quality raw material think smooth oakmoss inky vetiver exquisite ambrette seed fine floral absolute make experience intoxicate stop question cost second roja dove flush perfume sensual musks civet resin overripe fruit castoreum loosening stay uptight chypre structure make impossible wear without think sex bitter rich complex diaghilev scent old book musty theatre velvet curtain soak mitsouko sheen salty lickable postcoital sweat lover skin put smell diaghilev bucket list
nuwa extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums," Named for an ancient Chinese goddess known for creating mankind and repairing the pillars of heaven, and described by Roja Dove asThe Elixir of the Gods, it would seem that NÃ¼wa has a lot to live up to. Famously reformulated in 2015 to banish a heavy, animalistic cumin note, NÃ¼wa is now reborn as a floral oriental with a delicate transparency that jives better with its Chinese inspiration. It is simply exquisite. Now a gently-spiced floral with a peachy osmanthus heart and a backdrop of smoky black tea, NÃ¼wa is a fragrance to wear while strolling down the Riverside Promenade in Shanghai, slowly twirling a stiff silk umbrella over your head.

indian wood eau de parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," With the original PG 11, Harmatan Noir, Pierre Guillaume explored the concept of a robust desert wind, carrying a powerful contrast of sweet lemon mint and Jamaican allspice on its warm, dry breezes. With 11.1, Indian Wood, Guillaume returns to the idea of the contrast between aromatics and spices, but this time the mint in question is piquant peppermint set against a rich, quintessentially Indian blend of nutmeg and cardamom, delivering a nose-tingling bouquet of energetic depth. A blend of moss and balsamic woods further adds to the robust character, while the innate dryness of the central accord is offset with a judicious touch of coconut milk.

geisha vanilla hinoki- eau de parfum,Aroma M," Vanilla scents tend to have a cloying, candied effect.  But not Geisha Vanilla Hinoki.  Its key ingredient is a woodsy, smoky vanilla found only in Moroccoand very hard to come by. Five years in the making, perfumer Maria McElroy blended this delicacy with unexpected partner: Hinoki, a storied cypress. For centuries, this prized Japanese wood was used to build palaces, temples, shrines-- and those lingering hot spring pools known as onsen, found in mountainside inns.

shazam! eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," Oriental fragrances, by their nature, tend to aim for excess: more spices, more notes, more complexity, all in the pursuit of creating the rich, exotic depth inherent to the genre. But 4160 Tuesdays has never been the type of line to indulge in over-seriousness and groupthink, so Shazam! isn't your typical oriental- a tighter, more direct blend of indulgent amber, fresh spice, and surprising citrus and aromatics, Shazam! is both comfortingly rich and refreshingly direct- a true oriental for an oft-overwrought genre. Opening with juicy fresh tangerine and strikingly aromatic basil and juniper, Shazam! quickly warms up with a heart of rich woods, savory cardamom and smooth frankincense livened up with zesty pepper. As the incomparably gorgeous amber base develops, you realize that this is everything you love about oriental fragrance with none of the chaff. As the name suggests, Shazam! is fierce, striking and direct- a bolt of lightning to liven up a sometimes stodgy genre. We're paying attention."," Basil, tangerine, juniper berry, atlas cedar, pink pepper, cardamom, olibanum, amber, patchouli, cacao",oriental fragrance nature tend aim excess spice note complexity pursuit create rich exotic depth inherent genre 4160 tuesday never type line indulge overseriousness groupthink shazam not typical oriental tight direct blend indulgent amber fresh spice surprising citrus aromatics shazam comfortingly rich refreshingly direct true oriental oftoverwrought genre opening juicy fresh tangerine strikingly aromatic basil juniper shazam quickly warm heart rich wood savory cardamom smooth frankincense liven zesty pepper incomparably gorgeous amber base develop realize everything love oriental fragrance none chaff name suggest shazam fierce strike direct bolt lightning liven sometimes stodgy genre pay attention
aoud vanille eau de parfum,Mancera," Warm, rich, mysterious and striking, Aoud Vanille is a captivating scent that hovers between oriental and gourmand. The aoud here is front and center, anchoring a powerful opening of sharp agarwood, savory cardamom and redolent saffron that quickly disavow any notions that this will be an overly dessert-y pushover. A floral heart softens things slightly in transition to the vanilla-driven base, but it's a vanilla with backbone, anchored by a full bodied woodsiness that confirms Aoud Vanille's unisex bona fides and keeps the central vein of aoud detectable for hours. If Aoud Vanille is a gourmand, then it's one reminiscent of bold, adventurous cooking from a top tier chef; if it's an oriental, it's swathed in the precise, creamy comfort of a grand master. We'd prefer to think of it as the best of both worlds."," Oud, saffron, black pepper, cardamom, floral notes, vanilla, gaiac, sandalwood",warm rich mysterious strike aoud vanille captivate scent hover oriental gourmand aoud front center anchoring powerful opening sharp agarwood savory cardamom redolent saffron quickly disavow notion overly desserty pushover floral heart softens thing slightly transition vanilladriven base vanilla backbone anchor full bodied woodsiness confirm aoud vanille unisex bona fide keep central vein aoud detectable hour aoud vanille gourmand one reminiscent bold adventurous cooking top tier chef oriental swathed precise creamy comfort grand master would prefer think good world

Its enchanting opening begins with a radiant floralcy that smells like roses coated with succulent peaches and dusted with warm spices atop a rich sandalwood base laced with artemisia that bears tantalizing oud-like facets.

tabac tabou extrait de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," Long before it was commodified and commercialized by Europeans, tobacco had a long history in the indigenous Americas as a sacred plant, smoked or burned for shamanic healing, purification and dream-vision rituals. This is the inspiration for Tabac Tabou, a tobacco perfume unlike any other, which strips away the preconceptions of cigarettes and cigars and Western indulgences and returns this holy crop to the natural domain from which it originally draws its great, mystical power. In Tabac Tabou, the tobacco leaf arrives folded in whiffs of fresh hay and wild landscape, rich and utterly untamed. A green, fresh narcissus meets white flowers, rough-hewn leather and compellingly fur-like animalic notes. Sweet, honeyed immortelle supports the main ingredient's natural sweetness, while unannounced secret ingredients lend incredible depths of earthy yet delicate nuance, confirming our feeling that this isn't so much a standard fragrance as it is a direct pipeline to a mystical world that used to be. Featuring a high quantity of extremely rare and precious materials, Tabac Tabou is now part of Parfum d'Empire's permanent collection, but the fragrance will be produced each year in restricted quantities, with the label indicating the vintage."," Immortelle, tobacco, narcissus, honey, grass, musk",long commodifie commercialize europeans tobacco long history indigenous americas sacred plant smoke burn shamanic healing purification dreamvision ritual inspiration tabac tabou tobacco perfume unlike strip away preconception cigarette cigars western indulgence return holy crop natural domain originally draws great mystical power tabac tabou tobacco leaf arrive fold whiff fresh hay wild landscape rich utterly untamed green fresh narcissus meet white flower roughhewn leather compellingly furlike animalic note sweet honey immortelle support main ingredient natural sweetness unannounced secret ingredient lend incredible depth earthy yet delicate nuance confirm feel not much standard fragrance direct pipeline mystical world use feature high quantity extremely rare precious material tabac tabou part parfum dempire permanent collection fragrance produce year restrict quantity label indicate vintage

chrysolithe eau de parfum,Olivier Durbano," Mentioned in the Bible,  Qu'ran and holy texts across Asia,  chrysolithe (now often called peridot) is a gem-quality stone with a gold-green glow brilliant enough to more than explain why it inspired so much superstitious wonder across the ancient world. In his latestpoem of stones,  Olivier Durbano celebrates the majestic power of this magical and precious material with a spectacular scent,  equal parts fresh,  spicy,  green and warm,  that shifts from woods to aromatics to spice with captivating,  sparkling unpredictability. While Chrisolythe seems to have little use for the typical top-heart-base structure,  the first blast seems to give you a taste of everything,  with fresh,  tart verbena glowing against a mÃ©lange of dazzling spices and fiery ginger. As the uniquely green hyssop note emerges,  its raw,  camphorous qualities supplement various notes at random- for a moment pairing with rich cedar and sweet musk,  then changing to favor aromatic sage and rosemary or delicately floral jasmine. As might befit a stone imbued with ancient and mystical power,  we can't fully define what makes Chrysolithe so compelling.

messy sexy just rolled out of bed eau de parfum,A Lab on Fire," Everyone loves the smell of vanilla, and yet somehow the perfect, universally wearable vanilla seems elusively rare- mouthwatering bakery gourmands scare away lovers of wispier, more floral concoctions, and both varieties are often seen as too feminine for men to wear.

noir exquis eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The Parisian patisserie is so much more than a simple shop- it's a place of wonder, where exquisite pastry and invigorating coffee aromas set the backdrop for timeless friendships, fierce intellectual debates, lazy afternoons, and chance romantic encounters. It was the last of these things, the idea of love blossoming over eclairs and cafÃ© au lait, that inspired Bertrand Duchaufour to create Noir Exquis, a wondrous new gourmand that combines the mouthwatering scents of a patisserie with a deep, sophisticated, and luminous base of woods and floral amber that sings of attraction, connection and delight. Noir Exquis opens with a succulent combination of sweet orange and deep, rich chestnut, which soon opens up to a heart of syrupy maple and a true, full-bodied coffee that balances as perfectly against the sweets as the real thing. As it dries down, a delightful, lightly almond-inflected heliotrope blends perfectly with a creamy vanilla, while a notably darker wood note, described here as ebony, lends a dynamic and romantic touch to smoother, lightly powdery notes of tonka and sandalwood. What Duchaufour has created here is not a mere representation of a patisserie, but rather a capsule of every positive feeling one could associate with such a place. The results are truly lovely, and we're happy to say that Noir Exquis is a creamy, sweet, beautiful new achievement for one of our favorite perfumers."," Chestnut, orange, orange blossom, coffee, maple syrup, ebony, heliotrope, vanilla, tonka, sandalwood",parisian patisserie much simple shop place wonder exquisite pastry invigorate coffee aromas set backdrop timeless friendship fierce intellectual debate lazy afternoon chance romantic encounter last thing idea love blossom eclair cafa au lait inspire bertrand duchaufour create noir exquis wondrous new gourmand combine mouthwatere scent patisserie deep sophisticated luminous base wood floral amber sing attraction connection delight noir exquis open succulent combination sweet orange deep rich chestnut soon open heart syrupy maple true fullbodie coffee balance perfectly sweet real thing dry delightful lightly almondinflected heliotrope blend perfectly creamy vanilla notably darker wood note describe ebony lend dynamic romantic touch smoother lightly powdery note tonka sandalwood duchaufour create not mere representation patisserie rather capsule every positive feel one could associate place result truly lovely happy say noir exquis creamy sweet beautiful new achievement one favorite perfumer
phi une rose de kandahar eau de parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Phi is a luxurious scent, inspired by a natural extract of roses produced in Afghanistan's rose region, Nangarhar. This rose oil is extremely rare and of highest quality. Inspired by these roses, growing in a dry and rough land, Phi is a rare gem, complementing contrasting lines, rich in natural raw materials that add depth and authenticity. Due to the limited amount of the rose oil, Une Rose de Kandahar is not guaranteed to be available all the time.The scent starts with a rich fruity line of apricot. An all natural apricot extract with its surprising richness enchants and blends into a stretch of cinnamon and  hints of bitter almond, softened by bergamot essential oil. These spices lead over to voluptuous roses in the fragrance heart: Extremely rare rose essential oil with its unique scent of spices, plums and flower petals blends into rose absolute from Bulgaria and hints of Bourbon geranium. The rose petals melt on the skin into a dark tobacco fond, built around an amazing absolute of dried tobacco leaves. The animalic, leathery and woody tobacco opens the ground for a generously dosed layer of patchouli in the base of Phi. Here, woody and gourmand notes melt into hints of animalic lines. Vetiver, vanilla and tonka add richness and brilliance. A generous dose of exclusive musk and ambergris round the body of the fragrance and encircle the roses."," Apricot, cinnamon, almond, bergamot, Bulgarian rose absolute, rose from Kandahar, bourbon geranium, tobacco leaf, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, musk and ambergris.",phi luxurious scent inspire natural extract rose produce afghanistans rise region nangarhar rise oil extremely rare high quality inspire rose grow dry rough land phi rare gem complement contrast line rich natural raw material add depth authenticity due limited amount rise oil une rise de kandahar not guarantee available time scent start rich fruity line apricot natural apricot extract surprising richness enchant blend stretch cinnamon hint bitter almond soften bergamot essential oil spice lead voluptuous rose fragrance heart extremely rare rise essential oil unique scent spice plum flower petal blend rise absolute bulgaria hint bourbon geranium rise petal melt skin dark tobacco fond build around amazing absolute dry tobacco leave animalic leathery woody tobacco open ground generously dose layer patchouli base phi woody gourmand note melt hint animalic line vetiver vanilla tonka add richness brilliance generous dose exclusive musk ambergris round body fragrance encircle rose
sotto la luna tuberose eau de parfum,Tauer Perfumes," The genius of Andy Tauer has always been his ability to see past- or perhaps to not see at all- the conventional, in service of his own unique perception of the scents and notes he loves. So while for most, a ""natural smelling"" tuberose would default into cool, creamy rich white floral territory, Andy's Sotto La Luna Tuberose turns in the other direction, envisioning a beguilingly green, peppery floral that brings the ""queen of the night"" into bright, warm daylight.    Long time Tauer lovers will have particular reason to rejoice, as from the very first clove-spiced, galbanum-rich spray, it's clear that Sotto La Luna Tuberose is a throwback to Tauer's most iconic and distinct fragrances. Weaving through the rich spicy warmth of this full dose of ""Tauerade"", the heavy dose of natural tuberose absolute asserts herself-- creamy and floral as you'd expect, but so expertly blended against sweet ylang and stemmy jasmine as to bathe the notes in vibrant warmth and fresh green tones that feel spicy, natural and utterly unique. As the soft woods, patchouli and briskly musky ambergris base emerges, the tuberose is both softened and elevated, wonderfully recognizable while still leagues apart from any tuberose we've smelled before.

jasmin angelique cologne absolue,Atelier Cologne," When most fragrance houses announce a jasmine scent, it doesn't necessarily move the needle, but as a house dedicated solely to cologne-style compositions, the notably indolic, sensual white flower might seem a bit more challenging. Luckily for us, Jerome Epinette and Atelier Cologne have done it again- Jasmin AngÃ©lique is a stunning, crisply complex cologne absolue that balances layers of herbaceous green notes against a lovely, lilting jasmine accord that feels natural, fresh and warmly comforting. Jasmin AngÃ©lique opens with a crisp, spicy burst of Sicilian lemon, set against a fiery, energetic kick of Sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced by a floral yet fresh jasmine, resinous galbanum, and a lovely green fig note, which together give the impression of breathing deeply while walking through a meadow on a warm spring afternoon. This wondrous sensation lingers for hours, until slowly warming into the smooth, warm and light amber drydown. Vivid, green and aromatic, Jasmin AngÃ©lique is wholly unlike any jasmine fragrance we've tried before- and that's precisely what we love about it."," Lemon, Sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean",fragrance house announce jasmine scent not necessarily move needle house dedicated solely colognestyle composition notably indolic sensual white flower may seem bit challenge luckily us jerome epinette atelier cologne jasmin angalique stunning crisply complex cologne absolue balance layer herbaceous green note lovely lilt jasmine accord feel natural fresh warmly comfort jasmin angalique open crisp spicy burst sicilian lemon set fiery energetic kick sichaun pepper quickly balance floral yet fresh jasmine resinous galbanum lovely green fig note together give impression breathing deeply walk meadow warm spring afternoon wondrous sensation linger hour slowly warm smooth warm light amber drydown vivid green aromatic jasmin angalique wholly unlike jasmine fragrance try precisely love
iris cendre eau de parfum,Naomi Goodsir," Enigmatic, elegant and enchanting, the iris is one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients- and also one of its most challenging. So when we heard that Naomi Goodsir's first-ever floral was to be named Iris CendrÃ© (or ""Iris Ash""), our hearts began to flutter with anticipation of an Iris fragrance that might transcend convention and offer a bold new portrait of this beloved material. And even beyond our wildest dreams, Goodsir and perfumer Julien Rasquinet have delivered a bona fide masterpiece- a lush, warm, buttery interpretation of iris with a gorgeously restrained hint of smokiness that feels both wonderfully creative, and quintessentially Naomi Goodsir.Before even the first spray, Iris CendrÃ© affirms its rarity with a striking green color that results from its uniquely high concentration of true iris concrete, a property that gives the fragrance its striking depth and nuance. While the opening presents a crisp, delicately fruity burst of bergamot and spiced tangerine, the rich heart of buttery iris soon takes over, displaying a gorgeously evocative facet of the flower with warmer, more sultry tones than we've ever before found in an iris scent. A light veil of violet reinforces the floral depth, while a sensually smoky accord of cistus, tobacco and amber evokes the distinctly complex drydown of another Naomi Goodsir classic, Bois D'Ascese. The overall effect is both subtle and striking, a wholly unisex floral that seems to contain multitudes without ever raising its voice, feeling vivid and deep but also masterfully restrained. With Iris CendrÃ©, Naomi Goodsir and Julien Rasquinet have redefined what we thought an iris scent could be and in doing so, created a new reference."," Bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco",enigmatic elegant enchanting iris one perfumerys treasure ingredient also one challenge hear naomi goodsirs firstever floral name iris cendra iris ash heart begin flutter anticipation iris fragrance may transcend convention offer bold new portrait beloved material even beyond wildest dream goodsir perfumer julien rasquinet deliver bona fide masterpiece lush warm buttery interpretation iris gorgeously restrain hint smokiness feel wonderfully creative quintessentially naomi goodsir even first spray iris cendra affirm rarity strike green color result uniquely high concentration true iris concrete property give fragrance strike depth nuance opening present crisp delicately fruity burst bergamot spice tangerine rich heart buttery iris soon take display gorgeously evocative facet flower warm sultry tone ever find iris scent light veil violet reinforce floral depth sensually smoky accord cistus tobacco amber evoke distinctly complex drydown another naomi goodsir classic bois dascese overall effect subtle strike wholly unisex floral seem contain multitude without ever raise voice feel vivid deep also masterfully restrain iris cendra naomi goodsir julien rasquinet redefine think iris scent could create new reference

incense flash eau de parfum,Tauerville," For the third entry in his joyfully creative Tauerville project, Andy Tauer turns his attention to an ingredient that his primary line has ample familiarity with: incense. And while Incense Flash's woods-and-incense motif seems to cover some familiar ground, we're pleased to report that this earthy, leathery, compulsively sniffable scent walks a deft line between comfortable and creative, with ample appeal for lovers of Andy's previous incense work and newcomers alike. As would befit a fragrance named Incense Flash, the incense buzzes from the very first spray, dry enough to bring out the natural earthiness of the Boswellia Serrata incense used, but supplemented with a subtly musky, woodsy sharpness- dare we say a hint of the famous Tauer signature? As Incense Flash dries, the incense lingers, now paired against a wonderfully evocative leather- rough and dusty, yet as it dries increasingly supple and smooth. What now lasts for hours is a new reference for incense scents, less forest, painter's studio or bazaar and more starlit, high desert vista.

venetian bergamot eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Bergamot- fresh, fruity, spicy and complex- is perhaps the most unsung hero of perfumery of all styles and histories. Without bergamot, eaux de cologne lose their snappy freshness, fougeres forego their bracing sharpness, and chypres fall into flat, heavy dullness. It's therefore only appropriate that Tom Ford's new Venetian Bergamot, a modern-facing blend of these renowned styles of fragrance, keeps the noble bergamot front and center, sweeping us off our feet with the versatility and vibrancy of Italian bergamot carefully supported in a lush, fresh, spicy blend of woods and florals that refreshes and intoxicates all at once. Delicately creamy magnolia and sweet, fleshy gardenia and ylang ylang embrace smooth, robust cedarwood and cashmeran, while a sweet/spicy duo of black and pink pepper dance above the ground, each aspect enforcing and complimenting an aspect of the exquisite bergamot oil at the top of it all. Tom Ford has given fragrance's hardest working ingredient its very own feature- and we couldn't be happier."," Bergamot, black pepper, pink pepper, ginger, ylang ylang, gardenia, cedar, pepperwood, magnolia, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber, cashmeran.",bergamot fresh fruity spicy complex perhaps unsung hero perfumery style history without bergamot eaux de cologne lose snappy freshness fougere forego brace sharpness chypre fall flat heavy dullness therefore appropriate tom ford new venetian bergamot modernface blend renowned style fragrance keep noble bergamot front center sweep us foot versatility vibrancy italian bergamot carefully support lush fresh spicy blend wood floral refreshe intoxicates delicately creamy magnolia sweet fleshy gardenia ylang ylang embrace smooth robust cedarwood cashmeran sweet spicy duo black pink pepper dance ground aspect enforce compliment aspect exquisite bergamot oil top tom ford give fragrance hard work ingredient feature could not happy
la vierge de fer eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens has a history of playful names that subtly subvert the fragrances they're attached to,   but naming a lush,   gentle lily after a medieval torture device might take the cake. ""La Vierge de Fer,  "" after all,   translates to ""the iron maiden,  "" that infamous spiked coffin more associated with heavy metal than French fragrance. But as always,   there's a method to the madness,   with La Vierge revealing itself to be a beautiful lily-led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening and lightly metallic incense base suggest the maiden's deadly spikes with a wink and a smile.La Vierge de Fer opens,   as we mentioned,   with a bright dose of aldehydes,   charging the concoction with tingling energy and subtle sweetness. As the floral heart warms,   jasmine brings the luscious fullness,   while lily provides the edges,   fresh,   green and yes,   lightly metallic. This last,   thematically appropriate element is further reinforced with the incense base,   while the musk accentuates the sweetness that also carries throughout the life of this fragrance. Sure,   we can see the subtleties that must have put a smile on the Serge Lutens team's faces when they chose to name this fragrance after the iron maiden. But to us,   this gorgeous,   sophisticated,   easy to wear floral is the opposite of torture."," Aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk",serge lutens history playful name subtly subvert fragrance attach name lush gentle lily medieval torture device may take cake la vierge de fer translate iron maiden infamous spike coffin associated heavy metal french fragrance always method madness la vierge reveal beautiful lilyle white floral whose sparkle aldehydic opening lightly metallic incense base suggest maidens deadly spike wink smile la vierge de fer open mention bright dose aldehyde charge concoction tingle energy subtle sweetness floral heart warm jasmine bring luscious fullness lily provide edges fresh green yes lightly metallic last thematically appropriate element reinforce incense base musk accentuate sweetness also carry throughout life fragrance sure see subtlety must put smile serge lutens team face choose name fragrance iron maiden us gorgeous sophisticated easy wear floral opposite torture

mojave ghost eau de parfum,BYREDO," In the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. The ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground. Despite its arid surroundings and inability to produce nectar, the ghost flower, or mohavea confertiflora, maintains its perfect, majestic beauty and thrives year after year. In an astonishing feat of ingenuity, the flower uses mimicry to attract the pollinators of a neighboring plant species by developing markings that resemble those of a female bee, therefore attracting it and duping the male bee into following suit. This moving human-like behavior and captivating tale of survival lies in the foundation that inspired mojave ghost', an homage to this most bewitching flower.Mojave Ghost opens with a familiar yet mysterious fruit note, like a pear grown on another planet. Languid and almost buttery ambrette and sandalwood facets smooth and stretch these slices of fruit into a golden desert sunset, with petals of violet and magnolia basking in its diminishing light.

flowerhead eau de parfum,BYREDO," In the traditional Indian wedding, flower heads are strung together on giant leis, including Jaimala garlands which are exchanged between bride and groom as a token of mutual respect.

Flowers are abundant; from the mandap wedding canopy, which is entirely covered in exotic blooms, to the spiritual pooja rooms and verandahs, the explosion of colour is wildly celebratory and the scent is overwhelming.Ben Gorham, the visionary behind Byredo, used his impression of a bride in a Traditional Indian wedding as his inspiration for Flowerhead.The idea of marrying someone you don't know was very interesting. There's anxiety and excitement, and I described this person as a flowerhead', because the bride is completely covered in floral hair arrangements.Flowerhead has definitely set our hearts a flutter. It's a bold yet modern white floral; on one hand, it uses the classic combination of sambac jasmine and tuberose for it's floral heart, but without the slightest touch of cream or indole usually associated with white florals. Instead, the dryer aspect of white petals is blended with with a green rose, tart lemon and cranberry. Angelica seed adds a celery-green herbal dimension. Flowerhead doesn't shy away from the the classic white floral silage or volume. In fact we find this to be one of Byredo's most robust compositions yet-- after a slow gorgeous drydown, Flowerhead softens to a lingering wisper of suede and ambergris."," Angelica seeds, cranberries, sicilian lemon, sambac jasmine, rose petals, tuberose, suede and ambergris.",traditional indian wedding flower head strung together giant leis include jaimala garland exchange bride groom token mutual respect couple often showered petal grooms brother spiritual protection flower abundant mandap wedding canopy entirely cover exotic blooms spiritual pooja room verandah explosion colour wildly celebratory scent overwhelming ben gorham visionary behind byredo use impression bride traditional indian wedding inspiration flowerheadthe idea marry someone not know interesting anxiety excitement describe person flowerhead bride completely cover floral hair arrangement flowerhead definitely set heart flutter bold yet modern white floral one hand use classic combination sambac jasmine tuberose floral heart without slight touch cream indole usually associated white floral instead dryer aspect white petal blend green rise tart lemon cranberry angelica seed add celerygreen herbal dimension flowerhead not shy away classic white floral silage volume fact find one byredos robust composition yet slow gorgeous drydown flowerhead softens linger wisper suede ambergris

And yet, a sweet, pervasive honey holds the earlier notes in place as well- after all, Rome isn't a city that changes, but a city where ancient and modern take root together in a hypnotic whirl."," Bergamot, Wine, Resins, Davana, Cardamom, Carnation, Cinnamon, Iris, Honey, Frankincense, Agarwood, Ambergris",rome eternal city bustling modern metropolis thousand year history beat heart etched street zefiro pays homage rome baroque alchemy fragrance instant appeal grand mystery prestigious capital suggestive elusive vibrant unknowable zefiro open lavish giddiness il dolce far niente long weekend fine wine rich fruit cardamom cinnamon evoke mouthwatere cuisine wellspice bustle rome neverending crowd iris carnation represent beauty form perpetual spring season fashionable beauty every square nightclub rome also city history zefiro dry rich amber smoky incense remind us around every corner another masterpiecestuffed museum extravagant palazzo imperial stronghold yet sweet pervasive honey hold early note place well rome not city change city ancient modern take root together hypnotic whirl

white parfum extrait,Puredistance," What does happiness smell like? Surely, there are a million individual answers, and yet White, the result of Puredistance and Antoine Lie's quest to create a fragrance that would instantly evoke intense joy, glows with an undeniable, universal radiance. Born from the uncompromising quality of vision and material that Puredistance has become renowned for, White is much more than an ordinary bright, lush floral: it's a genuine work of breathtaking, yet nuanced, beauty that's impossible to dislike.The true, joyous beauty of White lies in its structure, which neither conforms to the traditional top-heart-base note configuration, nor is it what we normally consider linear. Instead, White is a giddily rotating ensemble of gorgeously lush Rose de Mai, immaculate sandalwood, lightly potent vetyver, orris butter and patchouli, and exquisitely deep tonka bean. One sniff may distinctly carry orris' powdery violet-like essence, another, luscious full-bodied rose, the next, rich, vanillic tonka. It's the type of elegant sophistication we've grown to expect from Puredistance, a compliment that makes White no less amazing. If Puredistance's goal was to create a scent it would be impossible not to smile around, then we're happy to say they've succeeded with flying colors."," Rose de Mai, tonka bean absolute, orris absolute, sandalwood, bergamot, musk, vetyver, patchouli.",happiness smell like surely million individual answer yet white result puredistance antoine lie quest create fragrance would instantly evoke intense joy glow undeniable universal radiance bear uncompromising quality vision material puredistance become renowned white much ordinary bright lush floral genuine work breathtake yet nuance beauty impossible dislike true joyous beauty white lie structure neither conform traditional topheartbase note configuration normally consider linear instead white giddily rotate ensemble gorgeously lush rise de mai immaculate sandalwood lightly potent vetyver orris butter patchouli exquisitely deep tonka bean one sniff may distinctly carry orris powdery violetlike essence another luscious fullbodie rise next rich vanillic tonka type elegant sophistication grow expect puredistance compliment make white no less amazing puredistance goal create scent would impossible not smile around happy say succeed fly color
cio cio san eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," Picture a stage set with paper lanterns and parasols, the rustling of silk kimonos, and trees bursting with cherry blossoms  the heightened, glowing version of a far-off place that you might see at the opera. Here you will find the endearing and ever-hopeful Cio Cio San, whom you might know better as Madame Butterfly. Forget, for a moment, her tragic ending and think instead of the heroine who lives in a happy bubble of memory, a confection of young love and nostalgia that is as lovely and fragile as her namesake. This scent evokes Cio Cio San's happiest days, opening with an exhilarating splash of yuzu, limette and ginger that is joined by a profusion of flowers. The first impression is that of walking into a garden in full bloom, but the heady peonies and cherry blossoms quickly become light and sheer as the exquisite sweetness at the heart of the fragrance appears. Lychee is an incredibly distinctive note that blends delectable juicy fruit with a soft, rose-like quality--it is both instantly familiar and impossible to place, like a candy eaten in a dream. A watercolor wash of oolong tea adds to this wistful nostalgia, creating an ethereal finish that is both clean and vibrant. Like a haiku that can conjure up an entire scene with a few well-chosen details, Cio Cio San is a serene meditation that evokes the springtime and romance of old Japan with heart-twisting clarity."," Yuzu, limette, lemon, ginger, grapefruit, cherry blossom, peony, lychee, oolong tea, gaiac, cedarwood, musk",picture stage set paper lantern parasol rustle silk kimonos tree burst cherry blossom heighten glow version faroff place may see opera find endearing everhopeful cio cio san may know well madame butterfly forget moment tragic end think instead heroine life happy bubble memory confection young love nostalgia lovely fragile namesake scent evoke cio cio san happy day opening exhilarate splash yuzu limette ginger join profusion flower first impression walk garden full bloom heady peony cherry blossom quickly become light sheer exquisite sweetness heart fragrance appear lychee incredibly distinctive note blend delectable juicy fruit soft roselike qualityit instantly familiar impossible place like candy eat dream watercolor wash oolong tea add wistful nostalgia create ethereal finish clean vibrant like haiku conjure entire scene wellchosen detail cio cio san serene meditation evoke springtime romance old japan hearttwiste clarity

grisette eau de parfum,Lubin," In the Belle Epoque, a grisette referred to the stylish young women employed in droves in Paris' booming sewing workshops. A fixture in the bars of Montmartre and the guinguettes on the Marne, the grisette was flirtatious, fun-loving, liberated, and full of the joie de vivre that inspired so much of the era's famed art and culture. Now as the newest fragrance from the venerable house of Lubin, Grisette is poised to capture the essence of these beautiful, industrious coquettes with a crisp, lush, spirited fragrance that you can hardly sniff without a smile. Grisette opens with bright citrus notes of grapefruit and bergamot, evoking the sun shining along the Seine as young roses- Moroccan and Bulgarian, presented as lovely and unpretentious as can be- wafts across the waters.

I wanted to have pear and plum because they remind me of summer in the Russian countryside of my childhood,   says Semionova. The top note of Williams pear brings forth a crisp,   juicy greenness. The heart of the fragrance is an accord of Egyptian jasmine with plum,   meant to evoke the lightness of a ballerina's gossamer costume. Finally the base of Precision & Grace,   a powerful yet subtle real sandalwood and musk combination that shows the tremendous physical strength that a dancer must possess in order to project the sublimely delicate beauty visible to the audience. Breezy and feminine,   yet hiding a deeper core of power and strength,   Precision & Grace is another unique and fascinating triumph for The Beautiful Mind Series."," Williams pear, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, Egyptian jasmine, plum, osmanthus, rose, mimosa, pink pepper, freesia, violet, sandalwood, myrrh, moss, amber.",volume 2 fascinating collaboration exceptional woman diverse field perfumer geza schoen choose team polina semionova internationallyfaate ballet danceri fascinated go mind great dancer dance say schoen precision must express grace result precision grace stunningly balance modern fragrance marrie uplifting fruity note soft floral perch atop warm deceptively strong woodsy drydown want pear plum remind summer russian countryside childhood say semionova top note williams pear bring forth crisp juicy greenness heart fragrance accord egyptian jasmine plum mean evoke lightness ballerinas gossamer costume finally base precision grace powerful yet subtle real sandalwood musk combination show tremendous physical strength dancer must possess order project sublimely delicate beauty visible audience breezy feminine yet hide deeply core power strength precision grace another unique fascinating triumph beautiful mind series

freeworld parfum,Regime des Fleurs," What,  precisely,  defines anAmerican Oriental,  as Ezra Woods and Alia Raza have chosen to categorize freeworld? We think a single sniff might be all you need to understand- while freeworld features a positively intoxicating mÃ©lange of spices and a warm,  earthy base that would more than qualify it as an oriental,  it crackles with a youthful exuberance and energy that paint a dramatically more upbeat,  casual picture than the snarling,  sultry grand dames of classic European takes on the genre.  With bright,  lemony geranium standing in for more opulent florals,  sparkling aldehydes and fizzy citrus adding light and levitation,  and a mouthwatering nutmeg and vanilla blend evoking memories of ice-cold root beer on a sweltering summer night,  freeworld feels as American as New York pizza,  apple pie or baseball- a few other things we once borrowed from overseas."," Geranium, citruses, neroli, nutmeg, coriander, sandalwood, vanilla, and aldehydes.",precisely define anamerican oriental ezra wood alia raza choose categorize freeworld think single sniff may need understand freeworld feature positively intoxicate malange spice warm earthy base would qualify oriental crackle youthful exuberance energy paint dramatically upbeat casual picture snarl sultry grand dames classic european take genre bright lemony geranium stand opulent floral sparkle aldehyde fizzy citrus add light levitation mouthwatere nutmeg vanilla blend evoke memories icecold root beer swelter summer night freeworld feel american new york pizza apple pie baseball thing borrow overseas
room 237 eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," It's not everyday that we get a fragrance based on one of the most terrifying films ever made, but that's precisely what Room 237 is- an homage to Kubrick's classic adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining, where the pastel-green bathroom of the titular room shelters an unspeakable evil. It's not exactly the kind of concept one attempts lightly, but Bruno Fazzolari has delivered something truly unique, a soft, enveloping, soapy-green scent that powerfully evokes a feeling of dreamlike confusion that's both wearable and, dare we say, at least a little bit disturbing. Like its source material itself, Room 237 doesn't smash you over the head with its more transgressive elements, but rather it draws you further into the room with Kubrickian deliberation- clean musk and resin flow together with synthetic plastic and vinyl notes that assert themselves in waves, keeping you sniffing at your wrist even though you know something about it feels wrong.  And just as Jack Torrance couldn't see the truth of Room 237's lone resident until he was at the edge of her bathtub and it was far too late, so too will you fall prey to this fascinatingly constructed fragrance. Horror fans, fragrance adventurers- you absolutely have to try this for yourself."," Angelica, Flea Bane, Estragon, Costus, Oppoponax, Olibanum",not everyday get fragrance base one terrify film ever make precisely room 237 homage kubricks classic adaptation stephen king shine pastelgreen bathroom titular room shelter unspeakable evil not exactly kind concept one attempt lightly bruno fazzolari deliver something truly unique soft envelop soapygreen scent powerfully evoke feel dreamlike confusion wearable dare say least little bit disturb like source material room 237 not smash head transgressive element rather draws room kubrickian deliberation clean musk resin flow together synthetic plastic vinyl note assert wave keep sniff wrist even though know something feel wrong jack torrance could not see truth room 237s lone resident edge bathtub far late fall prey fascinatingly construct fragrance horror fan fragrance adventurer absolutely try
monserrat eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," Like any true beauty, Monserrat is so much more than just a pretty face. Which is to say, while you may find yourself swooning over its luscious, brightly fruity opening, this is no simplistic department store fruity floral. It's a Bruno Fazzolari, and that means that what starts as a straightforward- if mouthwatering- burst of juicy peach and green grapefruit soon grows far more literate and complex with a delicately indolic jasmine and an unexpected plaster note that recontextualizes all that vibrant fruitiness into something delightfully dry- as if you were looking at a CÃ©zanne still life so masterfully done that you find yourself wishing you could take a bite. Fruity florals often get a bad rap, and not always undeservedly. But if they were all as clever, innovative and compelling as Monserrat, even the most die-hard critic might be singing a different tune."," Pink Grapefruit, Green Leaves, Carrot Seed, Osmanthus, Jasmine, White Musk, Setting Plaster",like true beauty monserrat much pretty face say may find swoon luscious brightly fruity opening no simplistic department store fruity floral bruno fazzolari mean start straightforward mouthwatere burst juicy peach green grapefruit soon grow far literate complex delicately indolic jasmine unexpected plaster note recontextualize vibrant fruitiness something delightfully dry look cazanne still life masterfully find wish could take bite fruity floral often get bad rap not always undeservedly clever innovative compelling monserrat even diehard critic may singing different tune

lampblack eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," The sudden, eerily calm darkness before a ferocious storm. The hushed, electric silence when the lights cut out and the curtain has yet to rise. The colors and shapes that dance in front of our eyes when we wake in the middle of the night and try to focus in the pitch darkness. This is what Bruno Fazzolari has captured in Lampblack, last year's much-buzzed-over cult sensation. Inspired by the smell of India ink, this triumphantly exciting fragrance is transparent and earthy and colorful and wholly unique, and we couldn't be more thrilled to offer it to you. Lampblack opens with a bracing citrus note, sweet orange coming up against bitter grapefruit, with a nose-tingling, borderline metallic black pepper asserting itself and establishing an off-kilter modernism to the whole affair. As the inky cypriol and earthy vetiver take over, the air continues to crackle with anticipatory energy, revealing the hidden depths of the darkness that still envelops the fragrance. Dark yet colorful, simple yet intricate, Lampblack embraces its contradictions for a modern, boldly creative scent that isn't just noticeably unique, but also uniquely easy to wear."," Sweet Orange, Black Pepper, Bitter Grapefruit, Nagamotha, Benzoin, Vetiver, Shadow",sudden eerily calm darkness ferocious storm hushed electric silence light cut curtain yet rise color shapes dance front eye wake middle night try focus pitch darkness bruno fazzolari capture lampblack last year muchbuzzedover cult sensation inspire smell india ink triumphantly exciting fragrance transparent earthy colorful wholly unique could not thrill offer lampblack open brace citrus note sweet orange come bitter grapefruit nosetingling borderline metallic black pepper assert establish offkilter modernism whole affair inky cypriol earthy vetiver take air continue crackle anticipatory energy reveal hide depth darkness still envelop fragrance dark yet colorful simple yet intricate lampblack embrace contradiction modern boldly creative scent not noticeably unique also uniquely easy wear
five eau de parfum,Bruno Fazzolari," As the first of his perfumes to be featured in a gallery alongside his paintings, Bruno Fazzolari paired Five withvivid and lively paintings in primary colors... lit by strong fluorescent lights. One sniff of this brisk, crisply assertive citrus/herbal/woods fragrance and the association becomes clear. Five is almost a traditional cologne- bright, fresh, and vibrantly spiced- but like the otherworldly fluorescents casting their own character on a painting, there's something in the balance of the fragrance, and in the lightly mineralic touches, that forces one to see the whole thing slightly askew. Aromatic rosemary mingles with a heavy dose of petitgrain and a 'high altitude' accord to give a robustly ozonic characteristic, as if pure oxygen was pumping from Five's otherwise traditionally composed heart. Like the gallery lights set up to deliberately alter your perception of the painting, Five is the traditional cologne born anew."," Lemon, Red Mandarin, Bergamot, Neroli, Rosemary, Petitgrain, Sweet Woods, Mineral & Saltwater Notes",first perfumes feature gallery alongside painting bruno fazzolari pair five withvivid lively painting primary color lit strong fluorescent light one sniff brisk crisply assertive citrus herbal wood fragrance association become clear five almost traditional cologne bright fresh vibrantly spice like otherworldly fluorescent cast character painting something balance fragrance lightly mineralic touch force one see whole thing slightly askew aromatic rosemary mingle heavy dose petitgrain high altitude accord give robustly ozonic characteristic pure oxygen pump five otherwise traditionally compose heart like gallery light set deliberately alter perception painting five traditional cologne bear anew
tempted muse eau de parfum,April Aromatics," Inspired by mythical ambrosia, the dessert of the gods, Tempted Muse is an irresistible fruity nectar - as sweet and sensual as it is bright and innocent. Perfumer Tanja Bochnig envisioned a drowsy-eyed muse waking up on a sunny morning in a flower covered meadow, still ""drunken on nectar and love"",  considering stealing a kiss from her sleeping lover. Tempted Muse opens like a sunrise - sparkling and warm - with grapefruit, frangipani and tuberose. The sweet freshness is balanced with balmy white florals and rose in the heart; and deepened by honeyed tonka, vanilla and sandalwood in the base. Perhaps the flirtiest scent we've smelled from April Aromatics, and we're smitten."," Frangipani, tuberose, jasmine, rose otto, tonka bean, sandalwood, ylang ylang, pink grapefruit, vanilla, anis fruit accord.",inspire mythical ambrosia dessert god tempt muse irresistible fruity nectar sweet sensual bright innocent perfumer tanja bochnig envision drowsyeye muse wake sunny morning flower cover meadow still drunken nectar love consider steal kiss sleep lover tempt muse open like sunrise sparkle warm grapefruit frangipani tuberose sweet freshness balance balmy white floral rise heart deepen honey tonka vanilla sandalwood base perhaps flirti scent smell april aromatics smitten
la religieuse eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," At turns delicate and animalic, pure and carnal, jasmine is rightfully considered one of perfumery's most versatile and valued notes.  Both reverent and blasphemous, La Religieuse (the nun) uses its jasmine to paint a portrait of a woman in full, where sweet and comforting give way to hidden depths of animalic desire, and ultimately, to freedom. La Religieuse opens with a gourmand flourish, as the fresh, lightly green jasmine combines with sweet, sugared mimosa and smooth incense to evoke imagery of a saintly servant of god, pure in her devotion and intentions, bringing comfort and joy to those under her care. But as it evolves, and a more animalic civet note begins to coax out the other side of the jasmine, we realize that this woman has her own desires, her own fantasies, and her own yearning to escape the life that has been given to her. While the sweetness lingers, the incense now feels dirtier, the musk sexier. La Religieuse never goes fully down and dirty, but the transition is thrillingly palpable: our heroine, while she might never go completely wild, is no longer content to be anyone's silent bride. Once again, Serge Lutens has delivered us a gorgeous, encompassing fragrance that tells a story we won't soon forget."," Jasmine, incense, civet.",turn delicate animalic pure carnal jasmine rightfully consider one perfumerys versatile value note reverent blasphemous la religieuse nun use jasmine paint portrait woman full sweet comfort give way hide depth animalic desire ultimately freedom la religieuse open gourmand flourish fresh lightly green jasmine combine sweet sugar mimosa smooth incense evoke imagery saintly servant god pure devotion intention bring comfort joy care evolve animalic civet note begin coax side jasmine realize woman desire fantasy yearn escape life give sweetness linger incense feel dirtier musk sexier la religieuse never go fully dirty transition thrillingly palpable heroine may never go completely wild no long content anyone silent bride serge lutens deliver us gorgeous encompass fragrance tell story not soon forget

kedu eau de parfum,MEMO," Kedu, nicknamedthe garden of Java in Indonesia, is a plain bordered by a volcano. Its soil, which has been made fertile by the ash, is sacred. Glossy green palm trees nonchalantly rub shoulders with one-horned rhinoceros, giant flowers in changing colours, prehistoric buffalo and bent-backed pilgrims.Tradition has it that you can purify your soul by throwing sesame seeds  one seed for each passion  into one of the flaming domes.

Now, MEMO and perfumer Alienor Massenet present this breathtakingly mysterious locale in a fragrance both mystifying and comforting, a full-bodied incense floral where Western ritual meets the delectably exotic, resulting in a fragrance that exists somewhere between earthly and divine- much like the city itself. Lalibela opens with a burst of patchouli-inflected spiciness and a compellingly mouthwatering coconut and orchid combination that feels as mystical as it does gourmand.

granada eau de parfum,MEMO," A feminine white floral with hidden complexities, Granada is an ultra romantic, surprisingly sensual late night dance through the gardens of the Alhambra. Inspired by late evenings beneath the walls of the famed red castle, the nighttime air redolent with Andalusian jasmine, Granada seduces us with a lightly resinous mix of clean and dirty florals that balance purity and carnality with expert precision. Granada opens sweet and bright, with bergamot and African orange flower balancing atop a delightfully dry grenadine note.

moon fever,MEMO," Is Moon Fever the fragrance of an imaginary safari on the mysterious dark side of the moon, as MEMO's promotional concept suggests? Or does it perhaps simply represent the multitude of stars visible in the perpetual dusk of the Serengeti night, where the planet's most majestic wildlife stares up at the same brilliant tapestry that you do? Either way, there's only one word appropriate to describe the crisp depths of Moon Fever: luminous. Moon Fever draws you in with a crisp, full citrus opening, blending fresh juicy mandarin with tart grapefruit, bright lemon and a lovely bitter orange for a citrus blend that's unexpectedly cool and full-bodied. The lightly earthy heart of verbena, primrose, vetiver and sage gives an almost tea-like smoothness, keeping the enchanting contrast between the black night sky and the sparkling stars as an enrapturing tonka bean drydown connects earth to heaven.

irish leather eau de parfum,MEMO,"It's one of those icy, biting mornings. The sun scarcely manages to break through the heavy grey clouds. The air is crisp and dry, and the wind slips beneath my clothes. The North wind whips the grass that sticks to my boots. I walk into the stable and swing open the wooden tack room doors, freeing the burning scent of leather, wood, amber and honey. Its age-old odor stands out sharply in the frozen morning air. My horse whinnies softly. It's the smell of her freedom. The leather gathers in the wind, the grass warms with the wood. Irish Leather gallops off into the horizon.MEMO co-founder John Molloy is understandably proud of his rural Irish upbringing, and Irish Leather, the first of MEMO's Cuirs Nomades series, positively sings of Ireland's rustic beauty. Opening notes of juniper, pink pepper and clary sage whisk us away to the wild countryside, while the leather- sharp, well-worn and deeply animalic- gives us the barn, the saddle and the horse all at once. Comforting yet forlorn, stark yet vibrantly beautiful, Irish Leather is among the most wonderfully wearable leathers we've ever experienced."," Pink pepper, clary sage, juniper berry, green matÃ© absolute, flouve, iris concrete, tonka bean absolute, leather, birch, amber accord.",one icy bite morning sun scarcely manage break heavy grey cloud air crisp dry wind slip beneath clothe north wind whip grass stick boot walk stable swing open wooden tack room door free burn scent leather wood amber honey ageold odor stand sharply frozen morning air horse whinny softly smell freedom leather gather wind grass warm wood irish leather gallop horizon memo cofounder john molloy understandably proud rural irish upbringing irish leather first memos cuir nomade series positively sing ireland rustic beauty opening note juniper pink pepper clary sage whisk us away wild countryside leather sharp wellworn deeply animalic give us barn saddle horse comfort yet forlorn stark yet vibrantly beautiful irish leather among wonderfully wearable leather ever experienced
italian leather eau de parfum,MEMO," The smell of leather can represent so much in Italian culture, from a couture jacket to ancient Roman armor. But for the Italian edition of their Cuirs Nomades series, MEMO and Alienor Massenet chose the ultimate depiction of the quintessentially Italian la bella vita- the leather-wrapped steering wheel of a top-down cabriolet hugging the curves on a coastal highway, young lovers tucked into the seats, hair whipping in the countryside-scented wind, a sumptuous picnic packed into a basket in the backseat. The first impressions of Italian Leather are fresh and green: tomato leaf and soft, lightly herbal vanilla, accompanied by a sharp, young leather that invigorates. As the leather matures and mixes with orris root and resinous galbanum, the warm, spicy outdoorsy qualities give off a hint of motor oil and coastal air, leaving us relaxed and excited all at once. Italians, as they say, are the French in a good mood- and one sniff of Italian Leather is bound to put you in a good mood all your own."," Green tomato leaf, vanilla, leather, rockrose absolute, galbanum, clary sage, iris concrete, vanilla bean absolute, sandalwood, tolu balsam resin, opoponax resin, myrrh resin, benzoin resin, leather accord, musk.",smell leather represent much italian culture couture jacket ancient roman armor italian edition cuir nomade series memo alienor massenet choose ultimate depiction quintessentially italian la bella vita leatherwrappe steer wheel topdown cabriolet hug curve coastal highway young lover tucked seat hair whip countrysidescente wind sumptuous picnic pack basket backseat first impression italian leather fresh green tomato leaf soft lightly herbal vanilla accompany sharp young leather invigorate leather mature mix orris root resinous galbanum warm spicy outdoorsy quality give hint motor oil coastal air leave us relaxed excited italians say french good mood one sniff italian leather bound put good mood

pomelo paradis cologne absolue,Atelier Cologne," The Pomelo may look like a jumbo-sized grapefruit, but don't mistake the two. They're actually distant cousins that share very little in common. Beneath the pomelo's bitter, bright green peel lies a pink fruit with the sweetness of an orange. Though pomelos have been loved in Southeast Asia for ages, they've only recently gained popularity in western groceries.Pomelo Paradis is Atelier Cologne's 7th cologne absolue in their Collection Originale, and is an homage to this unsung citrus. With one of the most mouthwatering openings we've ever smelled, Pomelo Paradis serves up both the crisp edginess of the peel with all the sweetness of its fruit; like the moment of pulling apart the juicy segments, with the peel just removed, not yet discarded.Pomelo Paradis sustains its crisp, sweet freshness by surrounding Floridian pink pomelo with heart notes of the highest quality -  tangy black currant bud, sweet Calabrian mandarin, Moroccan orange blossom, Bulgarian rose and Chinese mint.

debaser eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent,  Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail,  the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser,  named after the band's 1989 hit,  is not a typically creamy,  lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright,  hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic,  warm,  bold and woody fig.Debaser's refrain,  ""I am un chien andalusia, "" is a nod to the title of Luis BuÃ±uel and Salvador DalÃ­'s classic surrealist film. Black Francis said of BuÃ±uel,  ""I wish BuÃ±uel were still alive. He made this film about nothing in particular. The title itself is a nonsense."" D.S. and Durga's Debaser is therefor a tribute to a song about a film about ""nothing in particular."" And fittingly,  it's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown,  when it sheds the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris,  coconut,  tonka and moss -  leave a cool,  velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive."," Bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean and moss.",blare pixie music hot day inspiration ds dugas woody fig scent debaser anyone hear pixie front man black francis wail think fig scent may seem odd choice debaser name band 1989 hit not typically creamy lactic fruity fig bright hot green scent open waft fig tree broil august sun energetic warm bold woody fig debaser refrain un chien andalusia nod title luis buauel salvador dalas classic surrealist film black francis say buauel wish buauel still alive make film nothing particular title nonsense ds durgas debaser therefor tribute song film nothing particular fittingly fragrance become even compelling drydown sheds specificity figgy verisimilitude perfect blend base note iris coconut tonka moss leave cool velvetsoft hint wood skin earthy addictive
freetrapper eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," D.S. & Durga's Freetrapper distills a rugged landscape of rivers and tangled trees through sharp citrus and a sweet, warm shadow of cedar. It evokes the free-spirited trappers, traders, and mountain men who roamed the Rockies, living with the elements when trading in beaver pelts was necessary business, when the beaver (castor canendensis) was hunted for its fur and valuable musk. Freetrapper's heart notes of light, smoky incense encircles the bracing green citrus; like smoke on the horizon with the crush of faded greens underfoot on a trapper's weary trek homeward. It's the crisp yet animalic scent of wild dangerous times - of  loners, lawbreakers, vagabond merchants crisscrossing dense, aromatic and desolate wilds to make money, settle land, love local women and die with their beaver boots on."," Distilled incense, bergamot, bitter orange, dark cedar, snakeroot, osmanthus, amberwood, santal, and castoreum.",ds durgas freetrapper distill rugged landscape river tangle tree sharp citrus sweet warm shadow cedar evoke freespirite trapper trader mountain man roam rockie live element trading beaver pelt necessary business beaver castor canendensis hunt fur valuable musk freetrapper heart note light smoky incense encircle brace green citrus like smoke horizon crush fade greens underfoot trapper weary trek homeward crisp yet animalic scent wild dangerous time loner lawbreaker vagabond merchant crisscross dense aromatic desolate wild make money settle land love local woman die beaver boot
burning barbershop eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," In 1891, Westlake NY, a bottle of blackened cologne survived a conflagration that burned the Curling Bros. barbershop to the ground. Charred, reduced and dark, this scorched blend of vintage gentlemanly notes has been vividly re-created by David Moltz in all its pungent, roasted glory. The resonance and reach of Burning Barbershop is quite magnificent; a sweet rubbed spearmint note mixed with offbeat salted lime creates wonderful fumes of nostalgia. Everything smells baked and piquant. Lavender is a beautiful rich addition, smoky, hot and sugared, crumbled across the embers of the cologne's base notes. It is scent for flesh, not for paper and abstract wanderings. You might miss the most amazing soft-shoed vanilla as it dances softy in the smoke, tempering the excesses of bitter citrus and metallic pyrotechnics. A black, rubber whiff of night pervades the drydown, as if the skin is releasing soot into a starless sky. A scent of darkened wonderment."," Spearmint, lime, hemlock spruce, lavender absolute, turkish rose, burnt oil, vanilla, and hay.",1891 westlake ny bottle blacken cologne survive conflagration burn curl bro barbershop ground char reduce dark scorched blend vintage gentlemanly note vividly recreate david moltz pungent roast glory resonance reach burn barbershop quite magnificent sweet rub spearmint note mixed offbeat salt lime create wonderful fume nostalgia everything smell baked piquant lavender beautiful rich addition smoky hot sugar crumble across ember cologne base note scent flesh not paper abstract wandering may miss amazing softshoed vanilla dance softy smoke tempering excess bitter citrus metallic pyrotechnic black rubber whiff night pervade drydown skin release soot starless sky scent darken wonderment
bowmakers eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," If you can imagine a workshop, lit by oil lamps and a brace of flickering candles, wax dripping to the floor. Everywhere is wood, maple, mahogany, chips of darkest ebony, floor littered in fragrant curled shavings, the air filled with lacquered dust and the aromatics of a thousand sweet pencils. A man bends over an oak bench, tending to the curved form of a violin, the body warm and golden in the soft light, its neck, pegs and tailpiece scattered under his nimble fingers. Puffs of pine resin drift as he works, smoothing, gluing and attending to the preparation of varnishes and oils to give ornate lustre to grain and line. This is D.S & Durga's Bowmakers, an astonishing time capsule evocation of violin and bow making workshops in 18th century American pioneer towns. Each workshop concocted their own secret recipe for the decorative shellacs and lacquers. These might contain elemi, benzoin, saffron, mastic, sandalwood and turpentine for color, preservation, finish, tone and beauty.  D.S.& Durga have brought this polished, resinous portrait of craftsmen to life in an affecting and vibrantly glowing scent."," Violin varnish, mahogany, outdoors accord, amber pine resin, maplewood, cypress, spiced tree resin, cedar, and moss.",imagine workshop lit oil lamp brace flickering candle wax drip floor everywhere wood maple mahogany chip darkest ebony floor litter fragrant curled shaving air fill lacquer dust aromatics thousand sweet pencil man bend oak bench tend curved form violin body warm golden soft light neck pegs tailpiece scatter nimble finger puffs pine resin drift work smooth glue attend preparation varnish oil give ornate lustre grain line ds durgas bowmaker astonishing time capsule evocation violin bow make workshop 18th century american pioneer town workshop concoct secret recipe decorative shellacs lacquer may contain elemi benzoin saffron mastic sandalwood turpentine color preservation finish tone beauty ds durga bring polished resinous portrait craftsman life affect vibrantly glow scent
coriander eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," Coriander is perhaps one of the most inscrutable and left-field aromas in the D.S. & Durga canon. It is sparklingly green, but also a dry peppery herbal, and at the same time a delicate aquatic floral musk. Coriander defies easy classification. But where is the fun is labeling anyway? It might be the subtle, unexpected salinity that makes this scent such an enigma, that sea breeze drifting through the formula, deftly weaving pepper, juniper, geranium, magnolia, musk and mace around the heart of Ukrainian coriander.  As it unfolds on the skin it evokes a warm summer breeze off the Black Sea, rolling up the hills above Odessa. It's a light, fresh, energetic green."," Russian coriander, pepper, juniper needle, geranium, clove stem, clary sage, musk, magnolia, and mace.",coriander perhaps one inscrutable leftfield aromas ds durga canon sparklingly green also dry peppery herbal time delicate aquatic floral musk coriander defie easy classification fun labeling anyway may subtle unexpected salinity make scent enigma sea breeze drifting formula deftly weaving pepper juniper geranium magnolia musk mace around heart ukrainian coriander unfold skin evoke warm summer breeze black sea roll hill odessa light fresh energetic green
cowboy grass eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," Still as a silvered sunset on a dry summer's eve, Cowboy Grass crackles with quiet urgency across the skin. Parched and desolate, the sagebrush awaits the fire. The scent teeters on the edge of ignition, but seems somehow to hold back, soothed perhaps by a sense of latent moisture in the air, brushing through the flowering white thyme and prairie switchgrass. The rooty majesty of vetiver is one of perfumery's most vital and transcendent notes, the full flavor secreted away in the rhizome of Chrysopogon zizanioides which is harvested, hung and dried like precious game. Cowboy Grass is lit through with Haitian vetiver, known for its sweeter, smokier tones. The fragrance settles into a calming rhythmic aridity, vast and mysterious. We see the hands of Christina Olson in Wyeth's iconic 1948 painting planted firmly in the grass as she looks up at that distant haunting grey house. One of the most skeletal depictions of landscape in scent, Cowboy Grass is a quiet masterpiece, a poignant scent of hush and privacy."," Rosewood, wild thyme, bergamot, sagebrush, basil, rose otto, vetyver, grass, and ambergris.",still silvered sunset dry summer eve cowboy grass crackle quiet urgency across skin parched desolate sagebrush awaits fire scent teeter edge ignition seem somehow hold back soothe perhaps sense latent moisture air brush flower white thyme prairie switchgrass rooty majesty vetiver one perfumerys vital transcendent note full flavor secrete away rhizome chrysopogon zizanioide harvest hung dry like precious game cowboy grass lit haitian vetiver know sweeter smoky tone fragrance settle calm rhythmic aridity vast mysterious see hand christina olson wyeth iconic 1948 painting plant firmly grass look distant haunting grey house one skeletal depiction landscape scent cowboy grass quiet masterpiece poignant scent hush privacy
italian citrus eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," Any D.S. & Durga take on citrus notes will intrigue the senses and warm the blood. This is balmy sprawled afternoons under parasols, tugged gently by summer winds, books and neglected papers scattered softly in the temperate shade. The scent of citrus trees drifts by like a reminder of seasons lived and loved. There is so much depth to Italian Citrus, a balsamic, rounded fervor rare in this family of effervescent fleeting aromas. Designed traditionally to refresh and whet our olfactory edge, citrus scents use sparkle, zing and sherbet to widen our senses and awaken the torpid soul. This oddly powdered scent with its hints of sticky Campari and candied peel fuses traditional zest and peel with smoke and sweet animalics for an incredibly sophisticated patina of cocktail poise.

mississippi medicine eau de parfum,D.S. and Durga," Tribal pyres burning in the forests, with smoke from pine, holly, cypress, laurel, and cedar rising upwards to the gods.  D.S.& Durga looked to the funerary rituals of the early Mississippian Death Cult, the loosely connected network of tribes in America's regions around the 1200 AD, as the inspirations for the haunting yet comfortingly earthy Mississippi Medicine.Mississippi Medicine opens with herbal, woody top notes of freshly gathered juniper branches, twigs, lichen-clad bark, and sweet grassy violet - damp, cool, and dense with a stunning realism. Birch tar emerges like smoke mingling up through the wood and herbs of the pyre before it is consumed in flames. As the birch smoke floats above the skin in wafts of muted, spectral, gray in the scent's unfolding, the base of dry cedar and frankincense grows stronger. And in the final dry down all that remains is that incense and the woody embers, like the ash that was left after the pyres died down; after the smoke had reached the gods above and only the cinders remain to be covered and buried back into the soil."," Red cedar, aldehydes, frankincense distillate, cypress root, black pine, cascarilla bark, incense, spanish cade, and birch tar.",tribal pyre burn forest smoke pine holly cypress laurel cedar rise upwards god ds durga look funerary ritual early mississippian death cult loosely connect network tribe americas region around 1200 ad inspiration haunting yet comfortingly earthy mississippi medicine mississippi medicine open herbal woody top note freshly gather juniper branch twig lichenclad bark sweet grassy violet damp cool dense stunning realism birch tar emerge like smoke mingle wood herbs pyre consume flame birch smoke float skin wafts muted spectral gray scent unfold base dry cedar frankincense grow strong final dry remain incense woody ember like ash left pyre die smoke reach god cinder remain cover bury back soil

tagete eau de parfum,Profumum," The scent of a courtyard garden in Amalfi is, of course, far more than just the garden itself. On Italy's postcard-perfect Mediterranean coast, the lush, dewy florals of a carefully cultivated garden blend seamlessly into the ambient fragrance of the terroir: the wild plants, the mossy trees, the ocean itself. Breathtakingly, authentically beautiful, Tagete is an opportunity to visit one of the most peaceful locales on the planet- no matter where you might be.Tagete opens in a fresh, lovely burst of flowers, both wild and cultivated- rich, honey-sweet marigold, full-bodied jasmine, and the creamy, lively tuberose that Profumum perfected in their Tuberosa. A delicately earthy vetiver adds depth, while a damp, fresh moss bridges the gap between sea and earth. The overall effect is meditative, a stolen moment of reflection and appreciation. You've heard of a vacation in a bottle, but this is something more than that- call it genuine, beautiful tranquility."," Marigold, jasmine, tuberose, vetiver, moss.",scent courtyard garden amalfi course far garden italys postcardperfect mediterranean coast lush dewy floral carefully cultivate garden blend seamlessly ambient fragrance terroir wild plant mossy tree ocean breathtakingly authentically beautiful tagete opportunity visit one peaceful locale planet no matter may tagete open fresh lovely burst flower wild cultivate rich honeysweet marigold fullbodie jasmine creamy lively tuberose profumum perfect tuberosa delicately earthy vetiver add depth damp fresh moss bridge gap sea earth overall effect meditative steal moment reflection appreciation hear vacation bottle something call genuine beautiful tranquility
cap d'antibes eau de parfum,Eight and Bob," Sailing in the picturesque waters of the Grande Bleue, taking in a golden sunset from the gardens of the Eden Roc, enjoying a cocktail in the refined company of European aristocracy: summer on the French Riviera in the 1930s was the kind of glamorous existence that simply has no equal in contemporary society. For Albert Fouquet, it was the very pinnacle of life, one he was inspired to capture in a fragrance that might help chase away the doldrums of the cold Parisian winter. The resulting fragrance was Cap D'Antibes, an enveloping, sophisticated fougÃ¨re that was exclusive to Fouquet's private collection- until now. Cap D'Antibes immediately whisks you to the sun-kissed cobblestones of the south of France with a bright, sparkling opening of sweet violet, cool mint, and lightly resinous birch. The heart of the fragrance further invigorates, with cinnamon, moss, and a regional aromatic accord evoke fresh evening breezes and elegant cocktail parties. In the drydown, warm incense and delicate cedar intertwine with a perfect touch of relaxing vanilla. We may never see a time and place that can quite equal the glamour of Albert Fouquet's beloved Antibes.

ombre indigo eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," A voluptuous and smokey fragrance, Ombre Indigo is the scent of shadow. Ombre Indigo is an enigmatic fragrance; its blend of woods and smoked resins reveals the radiant opulence of tuberose laced with saffron and melts into swirls of papyrus, incense and benzoin.

cuir cuba intense eau de parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," Why name a fragrance Cuir Cuba Intense when a standardCuir Cuba doesn't even exist? One sniff of Patricia de Nicolai's stunningly complex new tobacco and leather scent should clear that question up. Rich, spicy, floral and animalic, Cuir Cuba Intense is such a gorgeously constructed head-turner that a more modest name would have felt like an understatement.Inspired by Mme de Nicolai's early memories of the family humidor, Cuir Cuba Intense opens with a nostalgic burst of lemon, mint and licorice, brisk and herbaceous, which conjures the wonders and pleasures of childhood. As the centerpiece tobacco leaf accord unfolds, smooth and musky, it's embraced by a soft floral bouquet and gourmand spice notes of cumin and coriander. The dry down reveals further amber/leather warmth and smoothness, blending seamlessly with the heart notes until making way for a sexy, animalic hay-and-civet final phase.

land of warriors eau de parfum,The Vagabond Prince," In the storybook world of The Vagabond Prince, our heroes are classic archetypes: noble monarchs, comely damsels, and, in the case of Land of Warriors, honorable yet ferocious adventurers clad head to toe in that most rugged of all materials- leather. In fact, Bertrand Duchaufour has stunned us yet again with his inventiveness, gifting Land of Warriors with a unique vertical blend of leather accords that emerge across every stage of the fragrance, paying tribute to multiple facets of this versatile, powerful material.We follow the leather in Land of Warriors through its impressively distinct phases, beginning with top notes of vegetal leather: violet leaf, cucumber accord and blackcurrant open fresh, tart and green. Before long, we encounter leather again, now in a more spicy, mineral state: syrupy davana and cistus absolute serve as a backdrop for oakwood, saffron and nutmeg, forming central notes that project with a refined but undeniable strength. As the more animalic facets of leather emerge in the form of castoreum, strength shares space with sensuality. Finally, the battle won, the warrior relaxes by the evening campfire, where the final smoky leather effect of styrax and tar swirls into an intoxicating base. A true gem of a leather scent, for warriors and modern-day heroes alike."," Angelique seed, violet leaf, cucumber accord, tomato leaf, blackcurrant leaf, oakwood, frankincense, davana, cistus absolute, saffron, nutmeg, oregano, castoreum absolute, ambergris accord, styrax, tar",storybook world vagabond prince hero classic archetype noble monarchs comely damsel case land warrior honorable yet ferocious adventurer clad head toe rugged material leather fact bertrand duchaufour stunned us yet inventiveness gift land warrior unique vertical blend leather accord emerge across every stage fragrance pay tribute multiple facet versatile powerful material follow leather land warrior impressively distinct phase begin top note vegetal leather violet leaf cucumber accord blackcurrant open fresh tart green long encounter leather spicy mineral state syrupy davana cistus absolute serve backdrop oakwood saffron nutmeg form central note project refined undeniable strength animalic facet leather emerge form castoreum strength share space sensuality finally battle win warrior relax evening campfire final smoky leather effect styrax tar swirls intoxicate base true gem leather scent warrior modernday hero alike
swan princess eau de parfum,The Vagabond Prince," As the old European fairy tale goes, a princess was turned into a beautiful white swan so resplendent in her plumage that anyone who touched her feathers was compelled to follow her wherever she went. Built around a lavish cocoon of six beautifully distinct musks, Swan Princess proves itself worthy of its namesake, delivering an enchantingly soft musky-floral that instantly puts you under its spell. As if first seeing the titular Swan from a distance, your first impressions of Swan Princess are sheer whiteness- sparkling clean aldehydes and crisp, fresh citrus, with only the tiniest zing of pink pepper for contrast.

violettes du czar eau de parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Of the many honors bestowed upon the legendary perfumers of France, only Oriza L. Legrand was ever given the title ofPurveyor to the Russian Court. As the standout fragrance from the ensuing royal collection, Violettes du Czar caused a sensation across the Courts of Europe, thrilling the men and women noble enough to wear it with its audacious fortitude. Now, Oriza L. Legrand has brought back this classic fragrance, and we're delighted to report that this violet-and-leather stunner is every bit as head-turning as it must have been 100 years ago. Much of Violettes du Czars' distinctive character comes, unsurprisingly, from the violets- specifically, the distinguished violets found in the south of France. Violettes du Czar showcases these prized flowers in all of their complexity, opening with the energizing sharpness of green violet leaves and earthy wild violet flowers before the sophisticated, lightly woody sweetness of the prized violets of Nice takes center stage in the heart, supported by iris and heliotrope. A virile yet silk-smooth accord of Russian leather anchors the base, adding power without sacrificing an ounce of sophistication. The days of the czar may be long gone, but his royal fragrance is back and better than ever."," Violet leaves, wild violet, violet from Nice, iris, heliotrope, tolu balm, leather, amber, and gaiac wood.",many honor bestow upon legendary perfumer france oriza l legrand ever give title ofpurveyor russian court standout fragrance ensue royal collection violette du czar cause sensation across court europe thrill man woman noble enough wear audacious fortitude oriza l legrand bring back classic fragrance delighted report violetandleather stunner every bit headturne must 100 year ago much violette du czars distinctive character come unsurprisingly violet specifically distinguished violet find south france violette du czar showcase prize flower complexity opening energize sharpness green violet leave earthy wild violet flower sophisticated lightly woody sweetness prize violet nice take center stage heart support iris heliotrope virile yet silksmooth accord russian leather anchor base add power without sacrifice ounce sophistication day czar may long go royal fragrance back well ever
heliotrope eau de parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," In the last 100 or so years, the heliotrope has been selectively bred to maximize its striking purple color, often sadly at the expense of its powerful, distinctive scent. How fortunate, therefore, that Heliotrope Blanc, created in 1886, honors the history of the flower by keeping the gorgeous vanilla-and-almond characteristics of heliotrope front and center. As a result, Heliotrope Blanc isn't just a fresh, elegantly blended floral with light gourmand touches- like all Oriza L. Legrand masterpieces, it's also a trip back through history. An exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level of this beautiful scent, opening alongside crisp violet leaves and orange blossom. In the heart, almond and mimosa draw out the heliotrope's indulgent side, drawing out the gourmand aspects of the flower while a sparkling iris keeps everything light and sheer. As Heliotrope Blanc dries down, musk and powder elements radiate softly, projecting timeless elegance. Not every heliotrope flower may smell as wonderfully as they used to, but as long as Oriza L. Legrand is around, we're happy knowing we can still get a gorgeous dose of the past."," Orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean.",last 100 year heliotrope selectively breed maximize strike purple color often sadly expense powerful distinctive scent fortunate therefore heliotrope blanc create 1886 honor history flower keep gorgeous vanillaandalmond characteristics heliotrope front center result heliotrope blanc not fresh elegantly blend floral light gourmand touch like oriza l legrand masterpiece also trip back history exquisitely rich heliotrope permeate every level beautiful scent opening alongside crisp violet leave orange blossom heart almond mimosa draw heliotropes indulgent side draw gourmand aspect flower sparkle iris keep everything light sheer heliotrope blanc dry musk powder element radiate softly project timeless elegance not every heliotrope flower may smell wonderfully use long oriza l legrand around happy know still get gorgeous dose past
myrrh casati eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Inspired by Marchesa Casati, the legendary patron of the arts and muse of eccentricity, known for her extravagant dark fashion and lavish fetes replete with exotic animals, gilded servants, and an infectious waft of incense and mystery that surrounded her.Myrrh Casati casts a sharp spell with its concentrated top notes of spicy Peruvian red berries and pink pepper. We are swept into the heart and star of the fragrance, dark myrrh enrapt in richly herbal bittersweet notes of licorice, cardamom and safron.

03. apr. 1968 eau de parfum,Rundholz Parfums," The ethereal properties of incense have inspired ritual and spiritual fascination in disparate cultures across the globe since the early beginnings of civilization. From the austere resins of Roman Catholic incense to the tartness of Indian Ayurvedic blends, it's a material with endless facets but a single, deeply mystical, heart. This is the foundation upon which German designer Lenka Rundholz commissioned Rundholz 03. Apr. 1968, a fragrance intended not merely to capture a single aspect of incense, but to represent that most cherished substance in its totality. The result, delivered masterfully by Arturetto Landi, is stunning: an utterly unique blend of incenses at once wise and playful, sexy and welcoming, with an individuality of spirit that immediately announces the wearer as one who would prefer to set trends rather than follow them. A juicy lychee note provides unexpected fruitiness at the top, making a bold, fashionable statement, while a heart of heliotrope gives a softly savory complexity to the heart. The incense, meanwhile, is the undeniable star of the show- every facet of this magical substance, from dry to rich to sultry, weaves in and out from one another to create a scent that continues to delight as it lingers on the skin for hours. As Rundholz has said, the moment-to-moment unpredictability is precisely the point- this gorgeous fragrance will manage to surprise you long after you've fallen in love with it."," Lychee, heliotrope, incense",ethereal property incense inspire ritual spiritual fascination disparate culture across globe since early beginning civilization austere resin roman catholic incense tartness indian ayurvedic blend material endless facet single deeply mystical heart foundation upon german designer lenka rundholz commission rundholz 03 apr 1968 fragrance intend not merely capture single aspect incense represent cherish substance totality result deliver masterfully arturetto landi stunning utterly unique blend incense wise playful sexy welcome individuality spirit immediately announce wearer one would prefer set trend rather follow juicy lychee note provide unexpected fruitiness top make bold fashionable statement heart heliotrope give softly savory complexity heart incense meanwhile undeniable star show every facet magical substance dry rich sultry weave one another create scent continue delight linger skin hour rundholz say momenttomoment unpredictability precisely point gorgeous fragrance manage surprise long fall love
nuit noire eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Dirty, dark and delicious, Mona di Orio's Nuit Noire is a throwback to perfumes worn by women who didn't work in offices, but rather used their scents to perfume fur, cigarettes... or other unmentionables.Nuit Noire starts with a surprisingly raunchy opening that combines cardamom and ginger with orange flower in a way that brings out the not-so-innocent orange flower's ripe-dirty side. From the beginning, Nuit Noire announces this perfume's rating: R, with a nod to triple-X. Incense and cinnamon-clove spices combined with the carnal tuberose then dries down,  if you can take it!   to a barnyard-y animalic dirtiness from leather and musk, no doubt with some sandalwood lurking around in the background.Although Mona di Orio's press materials asks us to imagine we're inThe souks, gardens, and hams of old Tunis (of course Nuit Noire's notes reference old Arabia), Nuit Noire's soul is decidedly Film Noir: erotic and dangerous."," Orange flower, cardamom, ginger, orange guinee, olibanum, cinnamon, tuberose, sandalwood, clove, cedarwood, amber, leather, musk, tonka.",dirty dark delicious mona di orio nuit noire throwback perfumes wear woman not work office rather use scent perfume fur cigarette unmentionables nuit noire start surprisingly raunchy opening combine cardamom ginger orange flower way bring notsoinnocent orange flower ripedirty side begin nuit noire announce perfumes rating r nod triplex incense cinnamonclove spice combine carnal tuberose dry take barnyardy animalic dirtiness leather musk no doubt sandalwood lurk around background although mona di orio press material ask us imagine inthe souks gardens ham old tunis course nuit noire note reference old arabia nuit noire soul decidedly film noir erotic dangerous
lux eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Like a chiaroscuro painting that contrasts extreme light with dark shadows, Mona di Orio's Lux (Latin for light) plays with an olfactory palette of light and dark. Lux starts off with a sparkling, sweet, and citrusy burst of Sicilian lemon and a lemongrass note from the Litsea cubeba, a tree in the evergreen family that is found in parts of Asia. This bright sweetness is tempered by the bitter-green herb note petitgrain signaling that, in spite of its name, Lux has more than a one-track mind.Darker tones of amber, benzoin, labdanum and vanilla add a creamy, heavier mood to Lux, while vetiver, cedar and sandalwood add texture and woods. While Lux's bright notes can still be felt in the drydown, an almost gourmand darkness takes over. To Lux's warmth and creaminess, di Orio adds another surprise as Lux takes on an unexpected dimension: an animalic drydown that lists musk in the notes, but that smells like civet to the nose.Like a walk in the woods as the day's light dims and the animal mystery of the forest is released, Lux's transformation is an olfactory wonder to behold."," Sicilian lemon, Litsea cubeba, petitgrain Bigarade South Africa, Haitian vetiver, Moroccan cedarwood, Mysore Sandalwood, Musk, amber, Siamese benzoin, bourbon vanilla and cistus labdanum",like chiaroscuro painting contrast extreme light dark shadow mona di orio lux latin light play olfactory palette light dark lux start sparkle sweet citrusy burst sicilian lemon lemongrass note litsea cubeba tree evergreen family find part asia bright sweetness temper bittergreen herb note petitgrain signal spite name lux onetrack mind darker tone amber benzoin labdanum vanilla add creamy heavier mood lux vetiver cedar sandalwood add texture wood luxs bright note still feel drydown almost gourmand darkness take luxs warmth creaminess di orio add another surprise lux take unexpected dimension animalic drydown list musk note smell like civet nose like walk wood day light dim animal mystery forest release luxs transformation olfactory wonder behold
lys noir eau de parfum,Isabey," The original edition of Lys Noir made its debut in 1924, the height of the glamorous anÃ©es folles, where its mysterious elegance and chic art deco design elements made it an instant hit among the fearless, trendsetting women that came to define the era. Now, 90 years later, the house of Isabey is again on the rise, and to celebrate the onset of their 10th decade, Lys Noir has been resurrected and updated for the modern market. We are delighted to confirm that this seductive, opulent woody floral fragrance is as perfect for the sophisticated femme fatale of today as it would have been all those years ago.As the name suggests, Lys Noir is built around the captivating, narcotic flower of the lily, which is accompanied at the opening with an invigoratingly spicy burst of black pepper. As the rest of the heady, deeply floral bouquet emerges- animalic tuberose, spicy narcissus- Lys Noir envelops us completely, drawing us further and further under its spell not with raw volume but with the sophistication and seductive appeal of its composition. A darkly attractive base of smooth patchouli, powerful ebony and milky sandalwood maintains a perfect harmony between beauty and complexity- just like the dynamic women for whom this fragrance is perfectly suited.

doe in the snow eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," The beauty of Sarah McCartney's playful, inventive creations lies in the specificity by which they're often created- inspired as she is by unique people, stories and requests, her scents are often more than a little out there- but they're never boring. Doe in the Snow, created for a customer's wintertime wedding, had a seemingly conflicting mission statement- make a big, fruity, mossy 60s/70s-style chypre, but make it cold.' The results are striking- citrus fruits, flowers and woods, stirred with an icicle. There's plenty of brightness from the grapefruit, yuzu and cedrat, but the cool, mossy leather notes and the sparkle of the aldehydes give a crisp chilliness to the light that feels like the sun rising across a frozen lake. Do you love the profile of big, vintage fragrances, but are uncomfortable with the idea of your scent entering the room before you do? Doe in the Snow lets you have it both ways. Graceful, yet practical, it's the casually opulent scent you never realized you needed."," Grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute.",beauty sarah mccartney playful inventive creation lie specificity often create inspire unique people story request scent often little never boring doe snow create customer wintertime wedding seemingly conflict mission statement make big fruity mossy 60 70sstyle chypre make cold result strike citrus fruit flower wood stir icicle plenty brightness grapefruit yuzu cedrat cool mossy leather note sparkle aldehyde give crisp chilliness light feel like sun rise across frozen lake love profile big vintage fragrance uncomfortable idea scent enter room doe snow lets ways graceful yet practical casually opulent scent never realize need
tart's knicker drawer eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"One day in the lab we were filtering six different fragrances at once. I tweeted,I'm about to get in the E3 bus smelling like a tart's boudoir. The replies came back,You should make it!I'd like to smell that oneCan I buy some? so the next day, I sat down and blended some versions of all six.It may have come to pass from an off-color joke, but as with most of Sarah McCartney's more spontaneous sources of inspiration, the end results more than justify the concept. Tart's Knicker Drawer, despite the name, is anything but overloaded- in fact, it presents the sophisticated, immaculately assembled feel of an elegant woman of the 1950s- fitted waist, hat, heels, perfect makeup, and full-bodied, expensive perfume.  In other words, while there's plenty of notes (as one might suspect from such a blend-intensive fragrance!), the result is both cohesive and surprisingly easy to wear. Indeed, Tart's Knicker Drawer wears its tongue-in-cheek moniker as a badge of pride, reveling in the thick cloud of big, powdery florals and spices and musky, rich base notes with a seductive confidence. If you're the type of person who can tell someone that you're wearing a fragrance named Tart's Knicker Drawer, then you're also the type who can pull off something this big, beautiful and fun."," Bergamot, orange, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, raspberry, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood, violet, tuberose, gaiacwood, amber, musk, vanilla, benzoin, tobacco.",one day lab filter six different fragrance tweetedi get e3 bus smell like tart boudoir reply come backyou make iti would like smell onecan buy next day sat blend version six may come pass offcolor joke sarah mccartney spontaneous source inspiration end result justify concept tart knicker drawer despite name anything overloaded fact present sophisticated immaculately assemble feel elegant woman 1950s fit waist hat heel perfect makeup fullbodie expensive perfume word plenty note one may suspect blendintensive fragrance result cohesive surprisingly easy wear indeed tart knicker drawer wear tongueincheek moniker badge pride reveling thick cloud big powdery floral spice musky rich base note seductive confidence type person tell someone wear fragrance name tart knicker drawer also type pull something big beautiful fun
red hoba eau de parfum,Xerjoff," A fragrance doesn't necessarily have to be a gourmand in order to make you smell good enough to eat. That was our first thought after trying Red Hoba, a rich, exquisitely spiced addition to Xerjoff's Shooting Stars collection that blends intensely smoky notes with growling animalic ones, and yet arrives at a result both thrilling and, yes, mouthwatering. Like a meal with a groundbreaking Michelin-starred chef, you may not understand how the flavors come together when you're reading the menu, but you certainly will once you try the results. Red Hoba opens with an almost-Christmas-y cinnamon and cardamom that dance on the skin and balance the floral and fruity nuances of a full-bodied bergamot. Warm orris, jasmine and patchouli swirl in harmony with gentle incense, but as the base emerges, a fiercely sexy mix of labdanum and castoreum mingle with a soft, comforting musk and a delicate gaiac wood. What category does Red Hoba fall into?

blue hope eau de parfum,Xerjoff," Conventional wisdom says that cool fragrances can't be passionate and gourmands must be sickly sweet. We're glad nobody told Xerjoff that, because Blue Hope, the newest Shooting Star, is a tantalizingly complex stunner that combines fresh citrus and delicate spices with a delectably sexy vanilla-based drydown. Blue Hope announces its year-round wearability with an opening blast of bright citrus, immediately given intriguing depth with a heart featuring rich, warm cedar and savory saffron. As the smooth, creamy vanilla of the base blends with the spices to create a mouthwatering mÃ©lange, an equally captivating castoreum/musk blend also asserts itself, balancing the delectable with the aphrodisiac. Finally, a fragrance guaranteed to make you smell delicious- in every way."," Bergamot, mandarin orange, saffron, cedar, jasmine, vanilla, castoreum and musk.",conventional wisdom say cool fragrance not passionate gourmand must sickly sweet glad nobody tell xerjoff blue hope new shoot star tantalizingly complex stunner combine fresh citrus delicate spice delectably sexy vanillabase drydown blue hope announce yearround wearability opening blast bright citrus immediately give intriguing depth heart feature rich warm cedar savory saffron smooth creamy vanilla base blend spice create mouthwatere malange equally captivate castoreum musk blend also assert balance delectable aphrodisiac finally fragrance guarantee make smell delicious every way
hedonist rose eau de parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya possesses an undeniable talent for flirty, gorgeous florals. Her Hedonist Rose is a take of light airiness - a bouquet of fresh roses with a crisp white wine accord, like a chilled Sancerre with a hint of peach. Top notes of lemon and peach give way to a sultry base of clove, amber, musk and vanilla.Hedonist Rose is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine golden liquid.

hedonist iris eau de parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Hedonist Iris is a perfect balance of the chic and the sensual. An elegant iris heart is warmed with cocoa, blackcurrant, labdanum, and musk. The effect is a graceful drydown, as the cool cloud of the iris petals settle into the warmth of labdanum and cocoa. Creamy, comforting and addictive (like an expensive French-milled soap), this is a must try for any iris lover.Iris being the most expensive raw material of all, I knew I did not need to search further when searching for inspiration for the new Hedonists. I concentrated on the flower's delicate scent instead of the root, which is what most perfumers do. Hence the scent is powdery but much more refined, and it reflects better the majesty of Iris. Timeless elegance is what I felt being expressed whenever I worked on each trial, and often times I get feedback that it just smells like The Woman. The indulging note here is cocoa, but I didn't want it to be overwhelming, so it stays delicately in the background. Labdanum gives a certain depth to the fragrance, which I found particularly interesting, while the composition stays sheer and chic.""  Viktoria Minya Hedonist Iris is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine liquid and the bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather.A Luckyscent exclusive!"," Bergamot, pink pepper, blackcurrant, iris, cedarwood, cocoa, labdanum, musk",viktoria minyas hedonist iris perfect balance chic sensual elegant iris heart warm cocoa blackcurrant labdanum musk effect graceful drydown cool cloud iris petal settle warmth labdanum cocoa creamy comfort addictive like expensive frenchmille soap must try iris lover iris expensive raw material know not need search search inspiration new hedonist concentrated flower delicate scent instead root perfumer hence scent powdery much refined reflect well majesty iris timeless elegance feel express whenever work trial often time get feedback smell like woman indulge note cocoa not want overwhelming stay delicately background labdanum give certain depth fragrance find particularly interesting composition stay sheer chic viktoria minya hedonist iris present within beautifully craft bottle fill hundred genuine bohemian crystal sparkle brilliantly divine liquid bottle enclose within handmade wooden box fashioned capture sleek look feel snakeskin leather luckyscent exclusive
eau de hongrie eau de parfum,Viktoria Minya," Viktoria Minya's Eau de Hongrie is the revisitÃ© version of the famous Eau de la Reine de Hongrie (Water of the Queen of Hungary). The original Eau de la Reine de Hongrie was the first modern perfume referenced ever.

musc tonkin eau de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," A powerful, addictive, erotic aura...The scent of heated flesh, solar, feline, subtly leathery. This elixir reinvents in a novel, contemporary style, the most suave note in perfumery, worshiped for millennia: Tonkin musk. More than a fragrance: an imprint.The Chinese have prized it since Antiquity for its aphrodisiac virtues. Its smell was considered so heavenly by Islam it was blended into the mortar of some mosques so that they would exhale it in the sun. It was so penetrating that ships loaded with tea would refuse to carry it for fear it would impregnate their cargo...Tonkin musk, produced by a species of Himalayan deer, was one of the most precious ingredients of the perfumers' palette: it suffused their blends with a sensual aura that fixed and magnified every other essence.No longer used for ethical reasons, natural musk still haunts perfumers since it has never been perfectly replaced. It is to capture this fascinating ghost that Musc Tonkin reinvents it by blending the most opulent raw materials to conjure its myriad facets. Their names don't matter: like the mysterious charisma of certain people who draw us into their wake, Musc Tonkin should be experienced rather than described.Vibrant, faceted, surprising, at once nocturnal and solar, this aphrodisiac potion changes on each skin, the better to enhance it. A lick of salt for the taste of skin. A heady floral whiff to remind us that perfume links our bodies to the erotic spells of nature. A mulled-fruit burn contrasting with a light, shimmering veil of powder...unctuous as honey, melting and waxy as the finest leather, the scent conjures living flesh heated by pleasure but also its mossy ink-black depths."," African stone absolute, musk, and after that, your guess is as good as ours.",powerful addictive erotic aurathe scent heated flesh solar feline subtly leathery elixir reinvent novel contemporary style suave note perfumery worship millennia tonkin musk fragrance imprint chinese prize since antiquity aphrodisiac virtue smell consider heavenly islam blend mortar mosque would exhale sun penetrating ship loaded tea would refuse carry fear would impregnate cargotonkin musk produce specie himalayan deer one precious ingredient perfumer palette suffuse blend sensual aura fix magnified every essence no long use ethical reason natural musk still haunt perfumer since never perfectly replace capture fascinating ghost musc tonkin reinvent blending opulent raw material conjure myriad facet name not matter like mysterious charisma certain people draw us wake musc tonkin experienced rather describe vibrant facete surprising nocturnal solar aphrodisiac potion change skin well enhance lick salt taste skin heady floral whiff remind us perfume link body erotic spell nature mulledfruit burn contrast light shimmering veil powderunctuous honey melt waxy fine leather scent conjure live flesh heated pleasure also mossy inkblack depth

patchouli absolu eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Patchouli Absolu is Tom Ford's personal ode to an ingredient that is intertwined with his own story. The iconic olfactive note of the 1970s, it evokes louche sensuality and after-dark glamour, as well as the heady blending of masculine and feminine that defined the era. This Eastern oil perfumed the skin of late seventies' glitterati and bohemians alike, pervading the air of jet-set parties with a provocative, dark glamour. Patchouli fragranced the world that was to shape Tom Ford's singular vision of style.Today, Tom Ford reinvents this influential ingredient into a truly vanguard scent for a new era. Patchouli Absolu merges three opulentand distinctly differentversions of this iconic plant ingredient. Patchouli oil contributes raw and primal texture; patchouli coeur, the ultra-luxurious, absolute extract of the plant, contributes an elusive and refined earthiness, and a breakthrough iteration of patchouli called Clearwood, used for the very first time in perfumery, is the most exquisite and pure rendition of patchouli's darkly addictive signature ever captured. The merging of these three facets creates the uniquely unconventional heart of the fragrance. They create a prism effect, reflecting off each other to intensify the depth and intrigue that is inherent to patchouli. Patchouli Absolu has a hypnotic signature that pulses with dark mystery.Patchouli Absolu opens with wave upon wave of refined patchouli that coats your skin like dark brown velvet glittering with gold. Spicy sweetness fuses with multi-faceted woods and smokiness to create a lush, deeply sensual mix with enormous warmth. Tom Ford goes beyond the dusty earthiness and blackened camphor of many traditional patchouli fragrances, opting instead for subtle hints of green mosses and a wisp of fresh herbs, all wrapped up with dark woods and golden amber. In the drydown, the spicy, smoky woods turn creamy and soft with a touch of leather that feels like suede. The end result is not only plush, bold, and elegant from start to finish, but a far cry from the dirty, raw scent of the patchouli oils from the 1970s. In short, this is a patchouli fragrance for the 21st century, darkly sensual, luxurious, and sophisticated."," Bay leaf, rosemary, moss, patchouli oil, patchouli coeur, patchouli Clearwood, guaic wood, cypriol, violetwood, cashmere woods, tonka bean, amber, musks, leather Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Patchouli Absolu by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

russian tea eau de parfum,Masque Milano," Out there, the snow-covered Nevsky Prospekt, and a sumptuous Art Noveau building. Inside, a large bookstore. And, on the first floor, an elegant cafÃ¨. As water is poured in the cup, the infusion unleashes its most characteristic notes. Black tea, heavy and intense. A floral note, sharp and biting. And that unmistakably dry and smoky aftertaste given by the caravanserai campfires, meant to keep the precious tea cargo dry in the never-ending journey through Siberia. The fresh mint leaves give a pleasant fresh touch to the hot water. A teaspoon of raspberry preserve sweetens, without altering it, the bitter aftertaste of leather and birch. We sip it slowly, gazing out of the wide window, towards the beautiful cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan and beyond. The Russian Tea Ritual today carried us to an unexpected journey in remote lands, full of mystery and fascination.Russian Tea is a journey, a day spent in Russia with a boiling Samovar, reigning in the house as the center of socialization and sharing. The black tea smell is strong, diffusing all around the house. It also evokes the journey of the tea through Siberia, taking the smell of campfires, and transportation in harsh conditions, interpreted by woody and leathery notes. The fresh mint leaves blend incredibly well with the smokiness, and the hint of raspberry and cinnamon that sweeten the bitterness of the tea.  Julien Rasquinet, perfumer"," Mint, black pepper, raspberry, black tea, magnolia, everlasting flower, leather accord, incense, birchwood, cistus-labdanum.",snowcovere nevsky prospekt sumptuous art noveau build inside large bookstore first floor elegant cafa water pour cup infusion unleashes characteristic note black tea heavy intense floral note sharp bite unmistakably dry smoky aftertaste give caravanserai campfire mean keep precious tea cargo dry neverending journey siberia fresh mint leave give pleasant fresh touch hot water teaspoon raspberry preserve sweeten without alter bitter aftertaste leather birch sip slowly gaze wide window towards beautiful cathedral lady kazan beyond russian tea ritual today carry us unexpected journey remote land full mystery fascination russian tea journey day spend russia boil samovar reign house center socialization share black tea smell strong diffusing around house also evoke journey tea siberia take smell campfire transportation harsh condition interpret woody leathery note fresh mint leave blend incredibly well smokiness hint raspberry cinnamon sweeten bitterness tea julien rasquinet perfumer

l'art de la guerre eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," There is an olfactive family, a perfume territory, which is traditionally emblematic of men; the Fern. This same fern that awakens in us the memory of the one who gave us our first romantic thrill, sometimes by stealing the fragrance of one of his elders.A woman wearing fern can do it in memory of past conquests or in nostalgia for the comfort of her father's arms. But she can also just do it to defy people around her with alluring and provocative scents. A man wears it for the same reasons, sometimes nostalgic, others conqueror, manly, confident.Francois Henin, Jovoy's owner and founder, needed a fresh, visionary and talented eye to address the delicate issue of revisiting such a classic universe. It was Vanina Murraciole, and the fragrance in development would soon be known as L'Art de la Guerre (The Art of War).""The first test made me smile. I knew that the first fresh and incisive rhubarb note was what this fragrance needed to stand out among its nine siblings. Then, the genius of aclean note, a handsome man who shaves himself, takes care of himself, perfumes himself. And at last, the long-awaited fern, slightly tinted by smoked immortal flowers, but woody and spicy....

A stroll in the woods becomes a trek through a primeval forest with a few glowing yellow eyes peering at you from the shadows. A dark and ethereal swirl of resins and animalic notes dances around a heart of amber, leather and musk-- and there is an intriguing undercurrent of something raw and untamed, softened by a soft whisper of sweetly narcotic tuberose. The overall impression is not heavy  but airy and elemental, like the landscape after a fierce and cleansing storm.  Iconoclast perfumer Geza Schoen (of Escentric Molecules fame) has taken his inspiration from the scent of raw opium.  It reminds us of wet stone, and the way rain unlocks mysterious scents from the earth. Imagine dancing around Stonehenge while thunder rolls through the sky. The inspiration is ancient, but the scent itself is very modernunusual, intriguing, and subtle enough to make it easy to wear, for both men and women.  Appropriately addictive."," Juniper, cardamon, pink pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, coriander seed, jasmin, rose, tuberose, angelica root, Opium accord, saffron, tonka bean, styrax, amber, treemoss, musk, leather, sandalwood, blonde tobacco",wode open spice green coriander cardamom clary sage juniper berry clean earth hint flower ocean seem quite brisk pleasant opium accord kick bitter unsettling hopelessly attractive stroll wood become trek primeval forest glow yellow eye peer shadow dark ethereal swirl resin animalic note dance around heart amber leather musk intriguing undercurrent something raw untamed soften soft whisper sweetly narcotic tuberose overall impression not heavy airy elemental like landscape fierce cleanse storm iconoclast perfumer geza schoen escentric molecules fame take inspiration scent raw opium remind us wet stone way rain unlock mysterious scent earth imagine dance around stonehenge thunder roll sky inspiration ancient scent modernunusual intriguing subtle enough make easy wear man woman appropriately addictive
l'orpheline eau de parfum - ...,Serge Lutens," Serge Lutens wants to explore the mysterious places between the moon and the earth through contrasting elements of black, white, silver, and plush cream. His new L'orpheline begins with the night sky, pitch black from smoky incense, then pierced by the silver light of the moon's sparkling aldehydes. Billowing clouds of myrrh add to the impression of crystal clear brightness, but they are also cool in the style of an Avignon incense fragrance. The incense and aldehydes swirl, dance, and weave their way down to earth where they settle on a pillow of cashmere woods and delicately spiced warmth. Very quickly, L'orpheline transforms itself into the most addictive blend of smoky, woody cream. Clean musk, amber, and a hint of spices dust the soft woods, but the fleecy softness outweighs them all. In its drydown, L'orpheline is like an angora blanket that hugs your skin with comforting, delicate coziness, giving you a gentle caress of meditative incense and pillow-soft creaminess. L'orpheline's transformation is complete. L'orpheline is an Haute Concentration eau de parfum, but its elegant softness make it one of Uncle Serge's more versatile creations. While it could easily be worn to work, we love to snuggle up to it after a long day at work. Its very serene drydown is a wonderful antidote to stress, or maybe we just really love creamy cashmere with incense."," Aldehydes,  cedar wood, Â fougere accord,  coumarin,  clouds of ambergris,  patchouli,  incense,  and Cashmeran",serge lutens want explore mysterious place moon earth contrast element black white silver plush cream new lorpheline begin night sky pitch black smoky incense pierce silver light moons sparkle aldehyde billow cloud myrrh add impression crystal clear brightness also cool style avignon incense fragrance incense aldehyde swirl dance weave way earth settle pillow cashmere wood delicately spice warmth quickly lorpheline transform addictive blend smoky woody cream clean musk amber hint spice dust soft wood fleecy softness outweighs drydown lorpheline like angora blanket hug skin comfort delicate coziness give gentle caress meditative incense pillowsoft creaminess lorpheline transformation complete lorpheline haute concentration eau de parfum elegant softness make one uncle serge versatile creation could easily wear work love snuggle long day work serene drydown wonderful antidote stress maybe really love creamy cashmere incense

sotto la luna gardenia eau de parfum,Tauer Perfumes," Sotto La Luna is a world that is secluded, private in a sense. The world is sleeping. The busy human world has come to a rest. Flower pods open, alluring the creatures of the night. Flowers bloom in the light of a celestial body that does not shine itself, but reflects the sun. It is a reminder of the day, a gentle light pouring down from a cold round rock in a frozen galaxy. The moonlight feels like a luminescent fluid poured over a shadow land. The shadows are long and dark. Sotto la luna is joyful and sentimental at the same time.Tauer's inspiration for Sotto La Luna Gardenia was the imagery of a gardenia under the moon. The scent flowers out with a spicy freshness, it matures into a round, gentle green floral perfume reminiscent of a hundred different flowers, it closes with powdery mosses and a creamy floral woodiness that disappears into the night. A soft gardenia, shiny but not blazing, a fine and beautiful flower, a harmonious perfume blending into the night.""Sitting next to my gardenia plant, smelling, making notes, I learned that the gardenia fragrance is different every day.

nymphaea caerulea extrait de parfum,Regime des Fleurs," An out of body experience,    Nymphaea Caerulea dances on the skin with extremely rare hyper-purified extractions of the sacred blue waterlily. The extraction used in Nymphaea Caerulea was only produced once ever in the early 2000s in India. Â The blossoms of two acre-sized ponds worth of Blue Waterlilies were carefully collected before sunrise when their scent was at its most potent. The blooms were then bathed with a special proprietary solution to gently dissolve the flowers and release the aromatic constituents without heat or pressure creating an extraction much like a traditional absolute but more ""clear"" in scent profile. This absolute was then refined further through a very careful low-heat hydro-distilation using only a copper and glass apparatus in the manner of the time-honored traditional attar-making process (but without the use of sandalwood oil),    further removing plant particles,    waxes,    and pigments. The care and precision applied to the production of this material is unparalleled. The result is a natural aromatic material that is stunning and truly once in a lifetime. Like the enchanting call of Sirens to chosen wayward ships,    the mesmerizing base of Nymphaea Caerulea features an abundance of genuine white Ambergris,    supported by celestial notes and shimmering accords composed of 80 ingredients: both precious naturals and intuitively selected aroma materials.The touching salty-sweet opening of Nymphaea Caerulea is at once nostalgic,    hopeful and altogether new. An uncanny lemony impression that bares no hint of tartness gives way to perfumed leaves and flower water. Constantly wavering betweendeep blue andemerald green,    air andwater,   boldness andgentleness,    the result is a symphonic aquamarine lullaby within a nebula. Among the many intriguing qualities of this perfume is that to some it recalls impressions of various unusual smells: freeze dried apple,    toothpaste,    glass cleaner... and yet there is an undeniable beauty and constant floralcy that dominates and mesmerizes the senses in the way that burying one's whole face in a giant lotus blossom would. Shimmering salt crystals on unripened berries. Smokeless incensed altar. Waterfall. And finally,    the haunting: the boldly lingering,    vaguely caramel,    oceanic ambergris.

journey man eau de parfum,Amouage," Like a Chinese dragon, Journey Man opens with a fiery roar filled with Sichuan peppers and bold spices in a golden, boozy flame. The peppers tingle and gently bite, while a richly fruited sweetness intoxicates you with a cognac note. It's a visual of gold and red, but darkness lurks all around, thanks to swirls of incense, an oud-like cypriol woodiness, and a streak of leathery resins in the base. Tobacco, a sprinkling of cardamom, and the juiciness of neroli orange are the final touches to a complex fragrance that grabs your attention from the start.Journey is slowly transformed by a beautiful creaminess which tames the dragon's fiery bite. A smooth layer of tonka vanilla coats the peppers, dry woodiness, incense, and spices. The cognac booziness turns into ambered warmth, and the perfume lingers more softly on the skin. Over time, Journey turns into a creamy, tonka sweetness with woods, spices, and just a hint of fruit mingle together. It's a bold fragrance whose initial intensity gives way to softness in a rich mix that feels very much like an Amouage."," Sichuan pepper, Bergamot, Cardamom, Neroli Bigarade, Juniper Berries, Incense, Geraniol, Tobacco Leaves, Ambrox, Cyriol, Tonka Bean Abstract",like chinese dragon journey man open fiery roar fill sichuan pepper bold spice golden boozy flame pepper tingle gently bite richly fruit sweetness intoxicates cognac note visual gold red darkness lurks around thanks swirls incense oudlike cypriol woodiness streak leathery resin base tobacco sprinkling cardamom juiciness neroli orange final touch complex fragrance grabs attention start journey slowly transform beautiful creaminess tame dragon fiery bite smooth layer tonka vanilla coat pepper dry woodiness incense spice cognac booziness turn ambere warmth perfume linger softly skin time journey turn creamy tonka sweetness wood spice hint fruit mingle together bold fragrance whose initial intensity give way softness rich mix feel much like amouage

or du serail eau de parfum,Naomi Goodsir," A dreamy meditation on dried fruit and Shisha tobacco. If your mind instantly goes to the cherry tobacco that graced your father's pipe in your youth, you're on the right track, but think more humid, more voluptuous, and more intricate. The fruit is a mix of apple, orange, mango and coconut, drizzled with honey and rum. The rich, golden tobacco is layered with greener, sharper aromatics, like clary sage and matÃ©. Throw in amber, vanilla and labdanum and you would assume this would be heavy and velvet-like - but instead it gives the impression of silken veils, each opulent and shimmering with fine embroidery, but sheer and vibrant. The veils float and swirl and each movement creates a different layering, a new set of colors playing against each other. The impression is indeed golden, rather than dark, and playfully seductive. There is a teasing haylike sharpness that freshens the smokiness of the tobacco and the mango and sweet orange give the amber a twist. A luscious vanilla floats through like something delicious being cooked in the next room. Bertrand Duchaufour has concocted a delightful invitation to temptation that hints at decadence in the most graceful way. Charmingly sensuous."," Cistus, apple & red fruit effects, mango, rum, sweet orange, davana, sage, bee wax, honey effect, coco, geranium, ylang-ylang, Turkish tobacco, amber, labdanum, oak tree, cedar wood, musk, vanilla, matÃ©.",dreamy meditation dry fruit shisha tobacco mind instantly go cherry tobacco grace father pipe youth right track think humid voluptuous intricate fruit mix apple orange mango coconut drizzle honey rum rich golden tobacco layered greener sharp aromatics like clary sage mata throw amber vanilla labdanum would assume would heavy velvetlike instead give impression silken veil opulent shimmering fine embroidery sheer vibrant veil float swirl movement create different layer new set color play impression indeed golden rather dark playfully seductive tease haylike sharpness freshens smokiness tobacco mango sweet orange give amber twist luscious vanilla float like something delicious cook next room bertrand duchaufour concoct delightful invitation temptation hint decadence graceful way charmingly sensuous

corsica furiosa eau de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," A verdant blast built around lentiscus, an evergreen shrub typical of Corsica. Wood, moss, earth, hay, honey, and in every shade, its sillage carries the smells of the mountain. Energizing and impetuous.Furioso. The term, used as a direction in music, meansto be played rapidly and with passion... Because Corsica, where Marc- Antoine Corticchiato has his roots, is never restful. It sends your eyes, your nose, your heart into overdrive. So when you're close to bursting with sensations and emotions, you take to the mountains.The perfumer's new tribute to his homeland was inspired by the moving scent that greets the returning traveler: the green, intense, facetted fragrance of lentiscus, a shrub that grows on the sunny slopes of Corsica, from the highlands to the Mediterranean seaside.But Corsica Furiosa is far more than that: the quintessence of everything that makes theIsland of Beauty unique, fierce and strong. The violent contrasts of its smells, colors, reliefs, passions, secrets...Since everyone in Corsica has their own recipe for it, a fiery swig of eau-de-vie sets the top notes ablaze. In its combustible wake, it trails the green bite of nepita, a local variety of wild mint. Crisp green tomato leaf intensifies the natural vibe.When lentiscus kicks in, the plot thickens. The headstrong essential oil is the first to take off. Peppery, fruity, aromatic, then earthy with mushroom overtones, it thrusts itself into the heart of Corsica Furiosa. Then the absolute takes over with a smoother shade of green with hay, blond tobacco, honey and straw accents, darkened with a tinge of liquorish. A third type of extraction, obtained through a special technique, adds wafts of resin, spices and leather that draw you deeper into the mountain... until you come to rest on a bed of moss."," Lentiscus oil, eau-de-vie, nepita (a local variety of wild mint), lentiscus absolute, tomato leaf, pepper, lentiscus extract original, cistus, oakmoss.",verdant blast build around lentiscus evergreen shrub typical corsica wood moss earth hay honey every shade sillage carry smell mountain energize impetuous furioso term use direction music meansto play rapidly passion corsica marc antoine corticchiato root never restful send eye nose heart overdrive close burst sensation emotion take mountain perfumer new tribute homeland inspire move scent greet return traveler green intense facet fragrance lentiscus shrub grow sunny slope corsica highland mediterranean seaside corsica furiosa far quintessence everything make theisland beauty unique fierce strong violent contrast smell color reliefs passion secret since everyone corsica recipe fiery swig eaudevie set top note ablaze combustible wake trail green bite nepita local variety wild mint crisp green tomato leaf intensifie natural vibe lentiscus kick plot thickens headstrong essential oil first take peppery fruity aromatic earthy mushroom overtone thrust heart corsica furiosa absolute take smoother shade green hay blond tobacco honey straw accent darken tinge liquorish third type extraction obtain special technique add wafts resin spice leather draw deeply mountain come rest bed moss

jardins d'armide eau de parfum,Oriza L. Legrand," Les Jardins d'Armide are a symbol of beauty, lush and beautiful, full of fragrant flowers and the rarest species. The beautiful gardens were long mythical, but the success of the Renaissance myth of Armida gave these imaginary incomparable gardens a new impetus. The Great Century in France did not escape the attraction of myths. There was a genuine passion for symbolism, illusions, and enchantments. Armide, an emblematic seventeenth century witch, was a woman of great beauty who knew the art of seduction. She best embodies the ambivalent powers of charm. She is inextricably tied to these extraordinary gardens, so much so that the term ""Gardens of Armida"" became a reference in fashion during the subsequent centuries. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Gardens of Armida are incessantly referred to in music (Lully, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Rossini ...), painting (Poussin, Van Dyck, Tiepolo, Fragonard ...) and literature. This myth began with another one, the myth of Tasso in the sixteenth century. In 1909, the prestigious Maison de Parfums Oriza L. Legrand presentedJardins d'Aramide to its elegant clientele, le tout-Paris, in its prestigious boutique 11 Place de la Madeleine.The perfume is a tribute to the legendary gardens and the women who have symbolized them throughout the ages.

the sexiest scent on the planet. ever. (imho) eau de parfum,4160 Tuesdays," What happened was that Sarah McCartney spent a week in the Hoxton Hotel courtyard in spring 2013,  making The Gin Garden scent with gin botanicals and a lovely smooth base for them to blend with.A couple of people,   including the visiting Tatler journalist,  fell in love with the base. The name came from one of the comments about it-- so Sarah thought perhaps it would be a good idea to bottle it the way it is. So she did.The idea was to make a gentle unassuming blend of background scents that wouldn't try to steal the limelight from the more individual gin botanicals. There is a dash of bergamot - a nice quiet citrus - and a soft hint of creamy vanilla. Then there's some velvety smooth woods and (non animal) musk and ambergris floating around. When one of their guests described it as ""The Sexiest Scent On The Planet. Ever. IMHO, "" they knew it had to be shared with the world. That's it really. And it's quite lovely,  to say the least."," Gin, bergamot, vanilla, woods, musk, ambergris.",happen sarah mccartney spend week hoxton hotel courtyard spring 2013 make gin garden scent gin botanical lovely smooth base blend couple people include visit tatler journalist fall love base name come one comment sarah think perhaps would good idea bottle way idea make gentle unassume blend background scent would not try steal limelight individual gin botanical dash bergamot nice quiet citrus soft hint creamy vanilla velvety smooth wood non animal musk ambergris float around one guest describe sexiest scent planet ever imho know share world really quite lovely say least

terralba eau de parfum,Masque Milano," In front of you, the sea. Behind, mediterranean shrubland.  It is morning.  The smells of shrubs and the earth mingle intimately and indistinguishably with the salty breath of the sea. You walk cautiously on the rocks of the small pathway leading to the beach, following  almost chasing  the sound of the waves, finding your way through the thick vegetation.

At last  in front of you  deep blue. The horizon expands and you abandon yourself to the sounds and the view of the mighty ocean sea.Terralba is a scent for those searching for an immediate mediterranean escape - it calls to mind Antonioni's L'Avventura, where a group of friends scours an isolated island for a woman who has gone missing among the freedom of the breeze and the sound of the waves.

Every single element of the interior contributes to the warmth and reassuring comfort. The floor of old robust wood planks, aged and worn with use. In the massive fireplace, coals are still burning. The comfortable couch is made of the best leather, once stout and rigid, and spotlessly tanned, is now soft and worn, and the color is fading away with years of sideways afternoon sun. A deck of used playing cards lies abandoned on the coffee table next to the tobacco leaves of a hand rolled cigar and a glass of rum.Montecristo strikes an impeccable balance between smokey and sweet and modern and classic.

luci ed ombre eau de parfum,Masque Milano," You walk through a thick wood where only small beams of light can shine through.  The trees are heavy with moss and the soft and spicy scent of earth. Determined blooms of jasmine and tuberose fight for the sparse light that will keep them alive. A shiver runs down your back and you feel the humid breathe of a wolf down your neck.  An uneasiness directs you into a broad meadow where the blinding light makes you sneeze. You overturn a log: damp ground and creatures that haven't seen the sun in years. You no longer know where you are or where you long to be. The dark side is irresistibly fascinating, perhaps stronger than any fears and uneasiness it produces.Luci ed Ombre speaks to chiaroscuro, or the practice of using light and dark in painting for dramatic effect.

bal d'afrique eau de parfum,BYREDO," Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent.  Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself.  A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupÃ§on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub  sweet and adorable, but it still has claws.  Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, african marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, moroccan cedarwood",bal dafrique inspire paris late 1920s city infatuate idiosyncratic fantastical vision african culture music dance paris embrace fabulous josephine baker muse enigmatic playful scent draw euphoric mix avantgarde exoticism fuel artistic life city jerome epinette create fragrance exuberant sensuality la baker vivacious blast sunny citrus pinch spicy marigold make suitably dramatic entrance lead brew green bucchu sheer aqueous cyclaman sweet violet center stage everbewitche vetiver earthy spicy smooth sweet amber warm musk become velvety almost edible extra soupaon growl provide cedar wood overall effect less voracious maneate tiger mischievous tiger cub sweet adorable still claws bal dafrique warm embrace purr cozy quality us mercy careful one addictive

The opening is crisp and outdoorsy  strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles.

A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top.

The romance of the bed strewn with rose petals intensifies as the petals mingle with the decadent fragrances of sensuality.  You can languish in that aroma, made peppery by freesia, and darkened with earthy cistus, green moss, and animalic musk. Rose Noir is a contemporary rose, dirtied up and served with a nice dollop of sensuality."," Grapefruit, freesia, rose damascena, cistus, moss, musk",rose good smell dark rise noir take innocence fresh damascene rise tramples underfoot romance bed strew rise petal intensifie petal mingle decadent fragrance sensuality languish aroma make peppery freesia darken earthy cistus green moss animalic musk rise noir contemporary rise dirty serve nice dollop sensuality
blanche eau de parfum,BYREDO," An effortlessly lovely ode to the color white. This opens with the crystalline sharpness of aldehydes, and then eases into a gentle white floral washed with soft sandalwood and transparent musk. Blanche is as light as a bubble floating on a warm summer wind and as clean as the steam from a long, hot shower. This is definitely in the family of freshly laundered scents, but it has a delicious warmth at its core that sets it apart. The ephemeral sweetness of the violet is anchored with the delectable milky richness of the sandalwood.  Blanche does not bring to mind harsh detergents or astringent cleansers, but rather the creamy lather of French-milled soap on clean, wet skin. As sheer and weightless as silk chiffon, you could wrap yourself in it and it would still read as delicate and airy. A classic and elegant rendering of the concept ofclean, it balances the brisk, fresh elements with soft, sensual ones. Pure and beautiful."," White rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk",effortlessly lovely ode color white open crystalline sharpness aldehyde ease gentle white floral wash soft sandalwood transparent musk blanche light bubble float warm summer wind clean steam long hot shower definitely family freshly launder scent delicious warmth core set apart ephemeral sweetness violet anchor delectable milky richness sandalwood blanche not bring mind harsh detergent astringent cleanser rather creamy lather frenchmille soap clean wet skin sheer weightless silk chiffon could wrap would still read delicate airy classic elegant rendering concept ofclean balance brisk fresh element soft sensual one pure beautiful
sunday cologne eau de parfum,BYREDO," In the 18th century, the Italian perfume maker of the original Eau de Cologne, Giovanni Maria Farina, wrote to his brother that,I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain.The essential qualities of eau de cologne, the lightest of all the perfume categories, with their fresh and casually elegant mix of citrus, floral, and herb oils, have remained intact throughout the centuries. This basic DNA of eau de cologne remains in Byredo's Sunday Cologne,  but with added body and depth, warmth and diffusion. Star anise and cardamom add a touch of olfactory heat and sweetness to Sunday Cologne. Meanwhile, incense adds a spicy bite; patchouli displays a rough, camphorous glow; moss and vetiver harmonize to add a touch of earthiness. Sunday Cologne perfectly balances crispness with warmth, convention with edge."," Bergamot, star anise, cardamom, geranium, incense, lavender, vetiver, moss, patchouli",18th century italian perfume maker original eau de cologne giovanni maria farina write brother thati find fragrance remind italian spring morning mountain daffodil orange blossom rain essential quality eau de cologne light perfume category fresh casually elegant mix citrus floral herb oil remain intact throughout century basic dna eau de cologne remain byredos sunday cologne add body depth warmth diffusion star anise cardamom add touch olfactory heat sweetness sunday cologne meanwhile incense add spicy bite patchouli display rough camphorous glow moss vetiver harmonize add touch earthiness sunday cologne perfectly balance crispness warmth convention edge
baudelaire eau de parfum,BYREDO,"...A lazy isle to which nature has given singular trees, savory fruits, men with bodies vigorous and slender, and women in whose eyes shines a startling candor.The poet Charles Baudelaire, famously a lover of perfume and the exoticism of faraway lands, was by turns cerebral, sensual, perverse, and sentimental. Byredo's homage to the French dandy reflects this mercurial nature with its multiple olfactory dimensions.A gentle sweetness lies at the heart of Baudelaire, with hyacinth warmed by amber and a touch of fruit. This sentimental center gives way to the aromatics of caraway, patchouli, and juniper berries, with their green whiff of the brisk outdoors. Baudelaire's base truly provides a counterpoint to its initial warmth, the way that his poetry often launches into philosophy: sensuality gives way to aridity, with a dry, incense-y base of leather, patchouli and papyrus.Earthy yet worldly, warm yet sophisticated, Baudelaire is as elegant as a dandy's walking stick."," Juniper berry, Black pepper, Caraway, Incense, Hyacinth, Leather, Papyrus, Patchouli, Black amber",lazy isle nature give singular tree savory fruit man body vigorous slender woman whose eye shine startling candor poet charles baudelaire famously lover perfume exoticism faraway land turn cerebral sensual perverse sentimental byredos homage french dandy reflect mercurial nature multiple olfactory dimension gentle sweetness lie heart baudelaire hyacinth warm amber touch fruit sentimental center give way aromatics caraway patchouli juniper berry green whiff brisk outdoors baudelaire base truly provide counterpoint initial warmth way poetry often launch philosophy sensuality give way aridity dry incensey base leather patchouli papyrus earthy yet worldly warm yet sophisticated baudelaire elegant dandys walk stick
la tulipe eau de parfum,BYREDO," A graceful rendering of the scent of a single, perfect tulip. What's that you say? You don't recall tulips having much of a scent? You are not alone. According to Byredo creator Ben Gorham,A lot of people say that tulips don't have a scent, so this is a fantasy based on the idea of a tulip. And we agree that this exquisitely realized soliflore of the imagination is exactly what a tulip should smell like. Clean, modern and bright, with an intensely floral heart and a bit of green stem that has broken through the icy ground to start the spring.La Tulipe captures the slight bit of waxiness of the tulip petals, thanks to rhubarb, and the cool, damp earthiness of the bulb, courtesy of vetiver.  It is refreshingly unsweet, and has a clarity and charm that makes it one of our favorites for those days when one just craves a breath of fresh air. La Tulipe is as simple and elegant as a single red tulip in a crystal vase and just as appropriate for any occasion."," Rhubarb, cyclamen, freesia, tulip, blond woods, vetiver",graceful rendering scent single perfect tulip say not recall tulip much scent not alone accord byredo creator ben gorhama lot people say tulip not scent fantasy base idea tulip agree exquisitely realize soliflore imagination exactly tulip smell like clean modern bright intensely floral heart bit green stem break icy ground start spring la tulipe capture slight bit waxiness tulip petal thanks rhubarb cool damp earthiness bulb courtesy vetiver refreshingly unsweet clarity charm make one favorite day one crave breath fresh air la tulipe simple elegant single red tulip crystal vase appropriate occasion
accord oud,BYREDO," Byredo's Accord Oud presents a striking set of olfactory opposites. The warm sweetness of blackberry and boozy rum pair with a camphorous glow from patchouli. And saffron's rounded softness is set against the sharp and smoky birch of a leather accord. Powdery musks resolve and fill in some of these opposites, and notes like clary sage complement the birch and patchouli.A resinous, aromatic, fruity leather, Byredo's Accord Oud suggests that oud is as much a mysterious set of olfactory characteristics  sweet, medicinal, soft, and dark  as it is an actual perfume note."," Blackberry, Saffron, Rum, Leather Accord, Clary Sage, Patchouli, Powdery Musks",byredos accord oud present strike set olfactory opposite warm sweetness blackberry boozy rum pair camphorous glow patchouli saffron round softness set sharp smoky birch leather accord powdery musks resolve fill opposite note like clary sage complement birch patchouli resinous aromatic fruity leather byredos accord oud suggest oud much mysterious set olfactory characteristics sweet medicinal soft dark actual perfume note
oud immortel eau de parfum,BYREDO," Oud is often thought of as dark, brooding and mysterious. Even the way it comes into the world has a whiff of drama about it: When the Aquilaria tree is infected by a mold, it secretes a protective resin which eventually becomes the precious, fragrant oud wood note. But Byredo's Oud Immortel bucks the trend and puts a smoky, earthy oud accord in the background, even though its name has top billing. It opens with a gourmand vanillic lemon accord, which contrasts with an earthy, herbaceous base of tobacco leaves, moss, patchouli and papyrus. This base cuts the sweetness with a mysterious dryness, making the scent edgier than sweet scents usually are. And, although it's not listed, it would make sense if the immortel flower, both savory and syrupy sweet, were romping around in Oud Immortel.Oud Immortel's lemon scent is courtesy of Limoncello, the aromatic citrus-fruity, candied Italian digestif, the major key personality to the oud's minor key. In the background, the slightly medicinal, camphory vibe from patchouli allows a brighter, happier, fruitier character to speak, accented with warming spices of cardamom.Smoke and mystery combine with sweetness and warmth to create a paradoxical fragrance both friendly and mysterious. Oud Immortel invites you in with candied lemon and cardamom, and then leaves you entranced with its smoky tobacco leaves, sheer oud accord, and moss."," Limoncello, incense, cardamom, patchouli, papyrus, Brazilian rosewood, tobacco leaves, moss",oud often think dark brood mysterious even way come world whiff drama aquilaria tree infect mold secrete protective resin eventually become precious fragrant oud wood note byredos oud immortel buck trend put smoky earthy oud accord background even though name top billing open gourmand vanillic lemon accord contrast earthy herbaceous base tobacco leave moss patchouli papyrus base cut sweetness mysterious dryness make scent edgier sweet scent usually although not list would make sense immortel flower savory syrupy sweet romp around oud immortel oud immortel lemon scent courtesy limoncello aromatic citrusfruity candy italian digestif major key personality ouds minor key background slightly medicinal camphory vibe patchouli allow bright happy fruitier character speak accent warm spice cardamom smoke mystery combine sweetness warmth create paradoxical fragrance friendly mysterious oud immortel invites candy lemon cardamom leave entrance smoky tobacco leave sheer oud accord moss
black saffron eau de parfum,BYREDO," Saffron is a spice. Saffron is a color. Saffron is a way of life. Black Saffron pays tribute to the many facets of saffron, weaving a spell of a spice symbolic of India. A vibrant citrus opening belies the deeper heart of the perfume. The aroma of saffron starts to wrap around you like holy robes, earthy and unmistakable. A dewy rose emerges, tickling your nose with a soft sweetness. Then, there it is, the surprise of leather nestled among the woods and vetiver. At once ancient and modern, Black Saffron brings all the traditions of the East alive while winking at you from the seat of a sleek motorcycle.Byredo founder Ben Gorham, who was raised in India, worked with perfumer Jerome Epinette to create this homage to the holy spice that has become a symbol of India."," Pomelo, saffron, juniper berries, black violet, accord cuir, cristal rose, blonde woods, raspberry, vetiver",saffron spice saffron color saffron way life black saffron pays tribute many facet saffron weaving spell spice symbolic india vibrant citrus opening belie deeply heart perfume aroma saffron start wrap around like holy robe earthy unmistakable dewy rise emerge tickling nose soft sweetness surprise leather nestled among wood vetiver ancient modern black saffron bring tradition east alive wink seat sleek motorcycle byredo founder ben gorham raise india work perfumer jerome epinette create homage holy spice become symbol india
inflorescence eau de parfum,BYREDO," A freshly cut bouquet of flowers that has been supercharged, as if struck by electricity or cross-bred with blossoms from another planet: radiant lily of the valley, honeyed freesia, creamy magnolia, incandescent jasmine  all captured at the height of their bloom, dazzling and stark white in contrast to glossy green leaves. The lily of the valley is especially vivid and luminous, giving this the heightened, otherworldly beauty of a perfect day in spring, with the skies a bright enameled blue and the new grass so vivid it is almost neon.Inflorescence is airy and euphoric. There is nothing dark or heavy to weigh down the dewy green notes or the profusion of glowing flowers. It has a scintillating lightness, in the sense that it floats and trills like a flute solo, not in the sense of being a shy or soft scent. This is bright and strongly present and joyously feminine from beginning to end."," Rose petals, pink freesia, magnolia, lily of the valley, fresh jasmine",freshly cut bouquet flower supercharge strike electricity crossbred blossom another planet radiant lily valley honey freesia creamy magnolia incandescent jasmine capture height bloom dazzle stark white contrast glossy green leave lily valley especially vivid luminous give heighten otherworldly beauty perfect day spring sky bright enamel blue new grass vivid almost neon inflorescence airy euphoric nothing dark heavy weigh dewy green note profusion glow flower scintillate lightness sense float trill like flute solo not sense shy soft scent bright strongly present joyously feminine begin end
1996 eau de parfum,BYREDO," Byredo's 1996 perfume was inspired by Dutch photography duo Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin's photographKirsten 1996,  which depicts an angelic child,  her face seemingly dusted with white powder,  her eyes closed and lips lacquered like a geisha's. 1996 is its olfactory counterpart: gentle and dreamy,  with an undertow of dark erotics.1996 bursts forth with a cloud of amber-scented iris,  as powdery-soft and diffuse as the incandescent photograph itself. A leather accord dosed with patchouli and black pepper gives its ethereal,  confectionary opening some heft and drama. Inez & Vinoodh move freely between both the fashion and art worlds and are known for their hyper-real and digitally retouched photos. They put a sheen of the otherworldly onto their images,  and there is something both earthy  the leather,  patchouli and rootiness of iris  and elusive and dreamy about 1996,  as if an added layer of fairy dust were sprinkled onto its more legible notes. Byredo founder Ben Gorham has said that 1996 isan olfactory snapshot not only of the image but of our emotional response to it. Enigmatic and romantic,  1996 will be sure to elicit perfume lust and emotion."," Juniper berries, black pepper, violet, leather accord, orris, patchouli, black amber, vanilla",byredos 1996 perfume inspire dutch photography duo inez van lamsweerde vinoodh matadin photographkirsten 1996 depict angelic child face seemingly dust white powder eye close lip lacquer like geishas 1996 olfactory counterpart gentle dreamy undertow dark erotic 1996 burst forth cloud amberscente iris powderysoft diffuse incandescent photograph leather accord dose patchouli black pepper give ethereal confectionary opening heft drama inez vinoodh move freely fashion art world know hyperreal digitally retouch photo put sheen otherworldly onto image something earthy leather patchouli rootiness iris elusive dreamy 1996 add layer fairy dust sprinkle onto legible note byredo founder ben gorham say 1996 isan olfactory snapshot not image emotional response enigmatic romantic 1996 sure elicit perfume lust emotion

nuit andalouse eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," A dreamy white floral centered around gardenia, the queen of tropical flowers. Nuit Andalouse opens with a sweet, delicate violet that perfectly sets the stage for the euphoric gardenia ahead, like a flower girl dropping petals before the radiant bride steps down the aisle. A sparkling orange note appears, clear and bell-like, which then blends with heady orange blossom, soft creamy vanilla and the luminous gardenia to create a fragrance with the luscious, but airy, quality of a mousse or semifreddo   smooth and delicious, but never too heavy or rich. Created by CÃ©cile Zarokian, this lovely scent pulls off the difficult feat of balancing elegance and charm. It is as exquisitely feminine as the rustle of silk skirts and as light-hearted as a kiss blown in the wind. Rose and ylang ylang contribute to the lushness of the flowers and sensuous sandalwood and musk add cozy warmth. All of these elements are but supporting players to the gardenia, however  doing whatever is necessary to show off our sweet and glowing diva to her best effect.

eight and bob eau de parfum,Eight and Bob," When American student John F. Kennedy met Parisian aristocrat Albert Fouquet on the Cotes d'Azur in the 1930s, not only was he charmed by the man, he was also intrigued by his hand-crafted scent. Upon his return to the US, JFK made a quirky request for eight samples and if your production allows, another one for Bob.EIGHT & BOB, as the cologne came to be known, was a hit with the Hollywood elite, but it would languish for decades after Albert's tragic death in a car crash. WWII forced Fouquet's loyal butler Philippe the only other person who knew the cologne's formula to hide his final shipment of bottles inside books that he carefully cut by hand.But EIGHT & BOB has returned. Based on its original formula, this bright, elegant cologne with the rareAndrea plant extract from the Andes. The Andrea species is a wild plant in short supply due to the altitude and limited area in which it grows, and can only be picked during the months of December and January. The plants gathered undergo a very exacting selection process in which only seven percent are chosen. This process ends between March and April and only then is it known how many units of EIGHT & BOB can be bottled for the year.A fragrance with a history, EIGHT & BOB is a true perfume event. The bottle is hidden in a book, just as it was long ago."," Citrus, spice accord, violet, iris, cedar, sandalwood, gaiac, ambergris",american student john f kennedy meet parisian aristocrat albert fouquet cote dazur 1930s not charm man also intrigue handcraft scent upon return us jfk make quirky request eight sample production allow another one bob eight bob cologne come know hit hollywood elite would languish decade albert tragic death car crash wwii force fouquet loyal butler philippe person know cologne formula hide final shipment bottle inside book carefully cut hand eight bob return base original formula bright elegant cologne rareandrea plant extract andes andrea specie wild plant short supply due altitude limited area grow pick month december january plant gather undergo exact selection process seven percent choose process ends march april know many unit eight bob bottled year fragrance history eight bob true perfume event bottle hide book long ago

cuir garamante eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," Leather can be many things  stern military boots, a worn-in saddle, a comfy chair. Cuir Garamante is a leather jacket  thick but supple  worn by a mysterious man who travels the world for reasons he keeps to himself. Journalist? Jewel thief? Spy? This is a jacket that has been to spice bazaars and state dinners and secret parties. It has snuck into palaces and jumped out of planes and hidden in opium dens. The opening has a tantalizing spiciness swirled with a swoony, boozy sweetness. Rich saffron, delicious nutmeg and sultry rose pave the way for the luxurious leather that is the central player. Although this leather does have the creamy aspect we love, it also has simmering animalic sensuality. It's a little bit rough, a little bit dirty and deeply sexy. Oud-like incense and sharp papyrus heighten the edgier qualities, while vanilla and sandalwood add a luscious warmth and smoothness. Weaving in and out is labdanum  smoky, sweetly resinous and mesmerizing. Addictive and fiendishly attractive  this is an outstanding interpretation of leather, one of our favorite notes."," Pink pepper, nutmeg, saffron, rose, oud accord, papyrus, leather, vanilla, labdanum, incense, sandalwood",leather many thing stern military boot wornin saddle comfy chair cuir garamante leather jacket thick supple wear mysterious man travel world reason keep journalist jewel thief spy jacket spice bazaar state dinner secret party snuck palace jump plane hide opium den opening tantalizing spiciness swirl swoony boozy sweetness rich saffron delicious nutmeg sultry rise pave way luxurious leather central player although leather creamy aspect love also simmer animalic sensuality little bit rough little bit dirty deeply sexy oudlike incense sharp papyrus heighten edgier quality vanilla sandalwood add luscious warmth smoothness weaving labdanum smoky sweetly resinous mesmerize addictive fiendishly attractive outstanding interpretation leather one favorite note
thirty three eau de parfum,Ex Idolo," Thirty-three is a fragrance crafted from very special ingredients. The soul of the fragrance is built around a vintage oud - distilled in 1980 and aged until its release in 2013.

oud wood eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends. Today, not only has Oud Wood become one of the brand's classics, but it has spawned the brand-newOud Collection, built around the original's core accord of oud, sandalwood and patchouli.Oud Wood's packaging may have changed, but fear not: you'll find the same powerful blend of cool spices and smoky woods, softened with a hint of vanilla and tonka bean. The daunting, medicinal and overly animalic facets of oud are toned down, translating the precious agarwood into a darkly elegant element of the perfumer's palette rather than a full-on French-Arabian extravaganza. As chic, urbane and sharply-cut as Mr. Ford's James Bond suits in Skyfall. And just as much of a sexy beast as Daniel Craig."," Oud, Chinese pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood Atlas, vanilla, tonka bean Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Oud Wood by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

tobacco oud eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends with Oud Wood.Along with the latter and Oud Fleur, Tobacco Oud is part of the brand-newOud Collection.  And in case you were wondering, any resemblance with Tobacco Vanille  a firm favorite in the Private Blends  is most emphatically not coincidental, since Tobacco Oud was composed by the very same perfumer, Olivier Gillotin. Here, the vanilla is ousted by  obviously  oud. The tobacco accord is less of a mellow pipe tobacco though it retains the delectable almondy inflection of tonka. Instead, it was inspired bydokha, a traditionalblend of herbs, flowers and spice-laden tobacco. And a heady blend it is, matching the fragrant smokes of oud resin and aromatic tobacco, with none of the side effects...If you've been hankering for a darker, sultrier, woodier version of Tobacco Vanille, or like to tame your oud with a touch of sweetness, a whiff of this might turn your head: it's one of Mr. Ford's most addictive offerings to date."," Oud, tobacco dust absolute, coriander, cistus, labdanum, cedarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, roasted organic tonka bean, castoreum Click Here For Ingredients ÃClose Tobacco Oud by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

The immutable fragrances are presented in Amouage's iconic clear glass-crystal bottles with a rainbow undertone with gold plated caps accented with an aurora borealis inspired Swarovski crystal.Fate Man is one of those rare perfumes where you just have to try it to understand it. It begins with an opening salvo of absinthe and herbs through a heart of immortelle swathed in the most luxurious frankincense. The wheel of fortune that is Fate Man ends up on cedar and licorice to bring this stunning perfume to a close. Despite being labeled as masculine, Fate Man is a true shared fragrance and if you are a fan of Amouage-- this is a must try.

fate woman,Amouage," Awarded 5 Stars (Masterpiece) by Luca TurinHow time flies. It seems only yesterday (actually five full years) that Christopher Chong took over Amouage's art direction and propelled this Omani firm, then known chiefly for its classic no-expense-spared Gold, into the first rank of perfumery. Chong is that rare bird, a natural perfumery art-director, who knows what he wants and will not give up until he finally smells it. In a recent interview with Style.com/Arabia, he said that Fate was a loud fragrance, so one expects a massively-built monster like the wonderful Ubar reissue in 2009. The surprise begins with the first puff from the spray: a fresh, radiant, powdery advance guard briefly fills the room. Seconds later, you are faced with one of the most intricate and beguiling fragrances in years. Nothing this big, complex and beautiful has been done since the first Boucheron. Though the top has a Guerlain-like appetizing feel, Fate borrows its core from Opium, i.e., woody-balsamic with an emphatic dose of the cool minty note that separates it from the merely warm, dusky Cabochard-Cinnabar style. Opium's virtue was its novel, instantly recognizable tune, of which we eventually tired. But don't let the reference put you off. Fate is to Opium what Mitsouko was to Coty's Chypre: a transfiguration. The central structure is deep in there, now cloaked in a cloud of radiant dust borrowed from the unstructured opulence of Gold, plusa brilliant toucha dry, fresh cigar-box cedar note to guard against excessive sweetness. Loud? Possibly, but comfortably so, without harshness or distortion. Like very few fragrances, Fate delivers the rush of physical glee you get when you sit in the front row of the stalls and a great orchestra begins to play.

lapis philosophorum eau de parfum,Olivier Durbano," Olivier Durbano's mineral-based fragrances have always been a labor of love, an attempt to synthesize the physical properties of his chosen inspiration with their deeper symbolic significance. With Lapis Philosophorum, Olivier has for the first time focused on an element not found in nature- the mythical Philosopher's Stone, legendary in the ancient world for its ability to change basic stone into gold- and the results are simply extraordinary.Lapis opens with an enticing, wine-laden burst of sweetness that is quickly tempered by Olivier's signature incense accord. Those familiar with Black Tourmaline will appreciate that warm, comforting embrace that keeps you sniffing for more. Truffle and menthol are unusual ingredients, and here they play out in a very subtle manner- truffle adds a creamy, ethereal element, while menthol, barely detectable, adds a liveliness to the composition that keeps it aloft. A rich base of opoponax, oakmoss and myrhh smooth the disparate edges while harkening to an ancient era where magic had yet to disappear from the world. Intoxicating, lively, and truly unique, Lapis Philosophorum is not so much a radical departure for Olivier Durbano, but rather the ultimate example of his ability to take unlikely ingredients and create pure magic."," Calamus, Juniper, Rum, White truffle, Grapefruit, Wine sediment, Oman frankincense, Mesquite, Ambergris, Menthol, Opoponax, Myrrh, Musk, Oak moss",olivi durbanos mineralbase fragrance always labor love attempt synthesize physical property choose inspiration deeply symbolic significance lapis philosophorum olivi first time focus element not find nature mythical philosopher stone legendary ancient world ability change basic stone gold result simply extraordinary lapis open entice wineladen burst sweetness quickly temper olivier signature incense accord familiar black tourmaline appreciate warm comfort embrace keep sniff truffle menthol unusual ingredient play subtle manner truffle add creamy ethereal element menthol barely detectable add liveliness composition keep aloft rich base opoponax oakmoss myrhh smooth disparate edges harken ancient era magic yet disappear world intoxicate lively truly unique lapis philosophorum not much radical departure olivi durbano rather ultimate example ability take unlikely ingredient create pure magic

champaca absolute eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Tom Ford's Champaca Absolute seems to glow from within with a mÃ©lange of warm fruit and floral notes that melt into a balsamic base. The Champaca flower has a soft, gentle, hard-to-place complexity, with notes of wood, spice, and mint. In Champaca Absolute, that note is combined with magnolia (with its delicate apricot facet), jasmine, and a marron glaÃ§Ã© accord (chestnuts candied and glazed in sugar syrup).

jasmin rouge eau de parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend," Jasmine is one of those perfume ingredients that can be played in many keys, depending on the pitch wanted  high, green and fresh, or low, indolic-dirty, and languid. Tom Ford's Jasmine Rouge/Private Label starts off like a fine glass of champagne, with a bubbly effervescence courtesy of an aldehyde-driven bergamot and mandarine. As it develops with piquante neroli, languid-to-tropical, waxy ylang-ylang, and warming, beguiling spices, Jasmine Rouge seems to explode into variations on jasmine's richness and lightness.

It opens with a creamy, almost coconut-y and even fig-fruit richness. Bold Indian spices of cumin and cinnamon give Santal Blush a temporary hot-and-heavy feral energy.

classical eau de parfum,Anat Fritz," Inspired by Berlin designer Anat Fritz's youthful memories of sun-drenched weekends in the countryside, Classical has long been that rare fragrance that evokes a near-universal sense of childhood. Now, having been reworked by one of Germany's most renowned noses (we're not supposed to tell), Classical has upped the ante, taking an already bright and comforting scent and rounding it out into a luminously nostalgic Eau de Parfum meant to take each wearer on their own unique journey.Just as before, Classical features three essential main ingredients. Wild lavender is still the beating heart of the fragrance, underpinned with rich cedarwood and gentle vetiver to evoke images of lush forests and rolling meadows full of children at play. In Anat's new reformulation, however, the Lavender is toned down, and complemented with the addition of creamy sandalwood--adding a blast of air and light, smoothing the edges into a shimmering composition that perfectly captures the ethereal beauty of a childhood memory- no matter where you grew up."," Lavender, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood",inspire berlin designer anat fritzs youthful memories sundrenched weekend countryside classical long rare fragrance evoke nearuniversal sense childhood rework one germanys renowned nose not suppose tell classical ante take already bright comfort scent round luminously nostalgic eau de parfum mean take wearer unique journey classical feature three essential main ingredient wild lavender still beat heart fragrance underpin rich cedarwood gentle vetiver evoke image lush forest roll meadow full child play anat new reformulation however lavender toned complement addition creamy sandalwoodadde blast air light smooth edges shimmering composition perfectly capture ethereal beauty childhood memory no matter grow
jeke parfum extrait,Slumberhouse," Jeke is a tobacco based fragrance with ornaments of spice, smoke and sweetness. Its heart is a rich accord of tobacco absolutes (Bulgarian, French and Spanish) paired with bourbon vanilla absolute and honey to create a sweet, milky tobacco base. The smoke and spice are constructed in a way to evoke the feeling of desolate autumn nights - the sting of smoke and the spice of burning leaves drifting through the cold black air."," Tobacco, vanilla, smoke, labdanum, patchouli, honey, clove",jeke tobacco base fragrance ornament spice smoke sweetness heart rich accord tobacco absolute bulgarian french spanish pair bourbon vanilla absolute honey create sweet milky tobacco base smoke spice construct way evoke feel desolate autumn night ste smoke spice burn leave drifting cold black air
norne parfum extrait,Slumberhouse," Few locations on earth bridge the gap between the terrestrial and the supernatural like the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Dominated by towering old-growth trees, shrouded in fog and deciduous shadow, these forests represent the few remaining places where mankind's dominion over the planet is far from absolute, and the wisdom of nature still supersedes the passing concerns of civilization. With Norne, Slumberhouse aims to capture the essence of this mystical place, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary.One glance of the ominously beautiful bright-black liquid makes it clear that Norne is far from a typical natural fragrance, and with the first powerful blast of fresh, resinous fir, it's confirmed. As the scent develops, other deeply complex woodland elements emerge: green moss, earthy fungus, fog, and a touch of slightly sweet incense that evokes images of a roaring campfire cutting through the damp air. While the clarity and strength of these notes is almost hard to believe, the explanation is simple: Norne is made with 100% forest absolutes, a complicated and costly process that avoids synthetics and essential oils in favor of natural, powerful ingredients. The result is a fragrance of unparalleled potency and depth, entirely suited to its subject. For lovers of the outdoors, fragrance enthusiasts in search of the  truly unique, or anyone with a love for the ethereal, Norne is not to be missed."," Fog caked needle, lichen, fern, moss, hemlock, incense",location earth bridge gap terrestrial supernatural like forest pacific northwest dominate tower oldgrowth tree shroud fog deciduous shadow forest represent remain place mankind dominion planet far absolute wisdom nature still supersede pass concern civilization norne slumberhouse aim capture essence mystical place result nothing short extraordinary one glance ominously beautiful brightblack liquid make clear norne far typical natural fragrance first powerful blast fresh resinous fir confirm scent develop deeply complex woodland element emerge green moss earthy fungus fog touch slightly sweet incense evoke image roar campfire cut damp air clarity strength note almost hard believe explanation simple norne make 100 forest absolute complicated costly process avoid synthetic essential oil favor natural powerful ingredient result fragrance unparalleled potency depth entirely suited subject lover outdoors fragrance enthusiast search truly unique anyone love ethereal norne not miss
ore parfum extrait,Slumberhouse," Gourmand fragrances aren't supposed to be dangerous, but nobody seems to have told Slumberhouse. That's good news for all of us, because Ore, with its sensuous heart of dry cocoa, lactonic balsams and dark wood, makes us think more of the bedroom than the dinner table. From the first smell of tantalizingly complex dry cocoa, it's evident that Ore has no intention of following in the footsteps of a typical gourmand. This is a rich, raw cacao note that blends seamlessly into the dark guaiac and oakwood to evoke the kind of sensual decadence that has nothing to do with the calorie count. A boozy caramel delivers enough warmth to bring a comforting balance to the mystery and provides a backdrop for the creamy balsam that's quickly becoming creator Josh Lobb's signature. No matter how you feel about traditional gourmands, one smell of Ore will be more than enough to make you hope that Slumberhouse never stops breaking the rules."," Oakwood, cocoa, mahogany, guaiac, dittany of crete (oregano), vanilla, whiskey lactone, peru resin",gourmand fragrance not suppose dangerous nobody seem tell slumberhouse good news us ore sensuous heart dry cocoa lactonic balsams dark wood make us think bedroom dinner table first smell tantalizingly complex dry cocoa evident ore no intention follow footstep typical gourmand rich raw cacao note blend seamlessly dark guaiac oakwood evoke kind sensual decadence nothing calorie count boozy caramel deliver enough warmth bring comfort balance mystery provide backdrop creamy balsam quickly become creator josh lobb signature no matter feel traditional gourmand one smell ore enough make hope slumberhouse never stop break rule

playing with the devil eau de parfum,By Kilian," Playing with the Devil is the fourth edition in Kilian's series of tributes to forbidden fruits. Here, as with the rest of the series, he uses the concept of good & evil as inspiration for a modern fruit-led composition. And as with the three previous scents in the series, naughty always wins out. The nectar freshness of lychee and the crispness of white peach playfully engage black pepper and pimento. The effect is a top with both a flirty tartness and a soft, powdery gauziness. All the crispness in the opening eventually gives way to a woody floral heart, wherein May Rose and jasmine Sambac soften earthy wood notes of cedar, Sandalwood and patchouli.  The rich, woody heart grows softer, even more powdery, and increasingly sensual as it dries down into its final animalic-tinged oriental base of tonka, benzoin and vanilla.Whatever games Kilian and perfumer Calice Becker were intending to evoke in Playing with the Devil, it seems the fun takes a delightful turn for the risquÃ© - perhaps like a seemingly innocuous game of Truth or Dare. It never fully abandons its freshness, and never gets too dark or dirty, but rather hints at a sensuality that every girl (good or bad) would want in her scent arsenal."," Blood orange, black currant, white peach, lychee, pepper, pimento, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, rose, jasmine, tonka, benzoin, vanilla",play devil fourth edition kilians series tributes forbid fruit rest series use concept good evil inspiration modern fruitle composition three previous scent series naughty always win nectar freshness lychee crispness white peach playfully engage black pepper pimento effect top flirty tartness soft powdery gauziness crispness opening eventually give way woody floral heart wherein may rise jasmine sambac soften earthy wood note cedar sandalwood patchouli rich woody heart grow soft even powdery increasingly sensual dry final animalictinge oriental base tonka benzoin vanilla whatever game kilian perfumer calice becker intend evoke play devil seem fun take delightful turn risqua perhaps like seemingly innocuous game truth dare never fully abandon freshness never get dark dirty rather hint sensuality every girl good bad would want scent arsenal
coccobello eau de parfum,HEELEY," Coccobello is truly intriguing and not your typical beach scent.  It is at once creamy and green, sweet and fresh, classic and cutting edge.  Think glamorous high-fashion resort wear spread in Vogue mixed with the lush and colorful tropical paintings of Henri Rousseau.  We know - it's that good.  Coccobello begins slightly green with wafts of palm leaves, cedar, and watery coconut.  While it remains a nice scent on paper, Coccobello absolutely comes to life on skin and works some kind of magic that we're still trying to figure out.  The benzoin, vanilla, and gardenia start a party that might end up with someone getting bitten, and something like mango butter makes an unexpected cameo.  The scent projects into a gorgeous, creamy, and slightly fruity veil of scent that lifts you away onto the perfect tropical beach vignette:  the breeze whispering through the palm trees, a cold drink in your hand, salt water dripping onto your towel, and nearby gardenias blooming with abandon.

1899 - ernest hemingway eau de parfum,Histoires de Parfums," Born on the edge of a century that changed the world order, Ernest Hemingway was involved in the u-turn events of his era. From USA to Spain, from Italy, then Paris to Cuba, Hemingway's journeys tell a lot about his convictions.Founder of a new genre, his writings depicted a new vision of the world, mixing reality and fiction.

rouge assassin,Jovoy Paris," Two types of women from the Twenties mingle in the same space without ever really meeting: One isla maitresse de ces messieurs, a mistress in the tradition of the Second Empire and thegarÃ§onne, a term for the emancipated woman, whose look may have been androgynous at times, but who Rouge Assassin pays tribute to those fearless, unstoppable women who upended the established order and broke all the rules. While the garÃ§onne look is sometimes considered masculine, femininity is what came through in the way women wore their hair and makeup, in their attitudes, their hunger for freedom and the insatiable desire to love without regard for social codes and conventions. She was the first in the history of women's fashion to reveal her legs. Soon, brassieres would replace corsets. Thick stockings vanished in favor of silk ones worn rolled over a garter above the knee. It was at this time that the first lipsticks appeared.The scent opens with the mysterious quality of both women's scents intermingling - sweet cigar smoke swirls and twirls in the dim light until it collides with a seductive cloud of powder.  Everything is in silhouette as the scent draws you in to explore its development -  the lipstick iris and saturated rose notes give way to a plush cushion of ambrette, vanilla, and benzoin.  The cedar note lends a kick of smoke that evokes a bewitching image - a pair of glossy red lips smoking a clove cigarette.Thanks to the collaboration of perfumer AmÃ©lie Bourgeois, Rouge Assassin is an homage to femininity that blends lipstick notes (iris butter), with the scent of skin (rice bran, musk, powdery floral accords) and echoes of Parisian cabarets.

lys 41 eau de parfum,Le Labo," A lavish, breathtaking, no-holds-barred big white floral that is drop-dead gorgeous.  While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage  jasmine and tuberose absolute.  They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room  creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat. In any configuration, you get a profusion of glowing white petals -- a soaring mix of the heady qualities of all three blooms -- warmed with gentle woods and a dreamy, cozy vanilla. While this is definitely not light in the sense of being understated, it is light in the sense of being airy and buoyant. It is an expansive airiness - a large billowy cloud of something weightless: rows and rows of ballerinas spinning in tutus, hundreds of white butterflies being released into the air, an impossibly long chiffon veil floating in the wind. Lys 41 is also filled with light  the bright white flowers have a brilliant luminosity which is burnished to a soft pearlescent sheen by the musk and vanilla.   The expectations are always high with Le Labo, and Lys 41, created in collaboration with one of Le Labo's iconic noses, DaphnÃ© Bugey, does not disappoint.  They have created the white floral that we wear in our dreams.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

ylang 49 eau de parfum,Le Labo," A sumptuous floral chypre with all the moody charisma of a film noir. Like the scarlet-lipped femme fatale with a shadowy past, the enigmatic Ylang 49 starts as a thing of straightforward beauty before leading us down a winding, slightly dangerous path.Ylang 49 opens with a powerful burst of classic chypre elements  a sultry sweet floral heart of gardenia and ylang ylang, countering a pungently earthy patchouli and oakmoss. But just when you think you've got it figured out, the ylang ylang and gardenia meld into a lush, buttery, exotic floral with hints of apricot. The tension between the creamy flowers and dusky oakmoss creates a gingery fizz and the deep thrum of rich sandalwood and resinous benzoin generates a velvety sweetness that highlights the titular ingredient's peachlike aspect. In the center of all this swirling intrigue is a warm, salty skin note that feels both sensuous and modern, provocative yet comforting. Like the mysterious beauty from so many stories, Ylang 49 is not meant to flirt with everyone it meets, but instead to seduce only the worthy.Exquisite secrets like the ones contained in Ylang 49 simply cannot be limited to either men or women. The only requirements are boldness, complexity, and a thirst for the extraordinary.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

mousse ii eau de parfum,Oliver & Co.," Oliver & Co.'s handcrafted fragrances are an intensely personal labor of love; created drop by drop to ensure that the end result is as spontaneous as it is satisfying. And while any other perfumer might be justifiably wary of tinkering with the unexpected balance of warm spice and cool musk that makes up the original MOUSSE, Oliver Valverde is not any other perfumer. The result is MOUSSE II, a thrilling reinvention that plays like a virtuosic take on a jazz standard, adding invigorating new depth to a familiar favorite.  Like its predecessor, MOUSSE II opens with the spicy warmth of clove against a strong backbone of sandalwood and oak moss. But while the original took its time to slowly develop its cool aldehyde and musk counterbalance, MOUSSE II ups the ante with a powerful blast of mint that immediately ties spicy and fresh together. As the fragrance dries on the skin, notes of lily of the valley and Mexican lime weave together for a rich, bright green that blends vitality and lightness with the ever present warmth of clove without a hint of contradiction. Many fragrances claim to offer perfect balance, but very few manage to pull it off with such creative panache. With MOUSSE II, Oliver & Co. stands alone.This perfume is a re-envisioning of the original Mousse eau de toilette that was originally released in 2011."," Sandalwood Mysore, clove bud Madagascar, lavender absolute, lime peel from Mexico, mint, aldehydes, cardamom Guatemala, musk, ambergris, muguet.",oliver cos handcraft fragrance intensely personal labor love create drop drop ensure end result spontaneous satisfy perfumer may justifiably wary tinkering unexpected balance warm spice cool musk make original mousse oliver valverde not perfumer result mousse ii thrill reinvention play like virtuosic take jazz standard add invigorate new depth familiar favorite like predecessor mousse ii open spicy warmth clove strong backbone sandalwood oak moss original take time slowly develop cool aldehyde musk counterbalance mousse ii ups ante powerful blast mint immediately tie spicy fresh together fragrance dry skin note lily valley mexican lime weave together rich bright green blend vitality lightness ever present warmth clove without hint contradiction many fragrance claim offer perfect balance manage pull creative panache mousse ii oliver co stand alone perfume reenvisioning original mousse eau de toilette originally release 2011
resina eau de parfum,Oliver & Co.," To say that a fragrance has the power to transport implies a strong sense of place; the salty ocean, the lush forest, a flower-filled meadow. Oliver & Co.'s hypnotic Resina, on the other hand, transports the wearer not only to a different place, but also to a different time, a sultry and mystical forest of the ancients where the miraculous is commonplace, and beauty and wisdom are inextricably intertwined. Opening with an attention-catching burst of ginger and star anise, Resina quickly fills out with an opulent accord of precious woods and resins: tolu balsalm, elemi, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum. A subtle undercurrent of coffee and jasmine only furthers the sensation of exploring an earthy, mist-filled forest, brimming with ancestral knowledge. Spicy without a hint of stuffiness, rich and woody while not the least bit sweet, Resina reveals her secrets only to those who can prove themselves truly worthy."," Tolu balsam, elemi Philippines, myrrh, labdanum Spain, opopanax, frankincense Somalia, benzoin Siam, coffee co2 extract, jasmine sambac, Australian fire tree, rooibos tincture, macis, tonka bean Venezuela, fir balsam, ginger, star anise.",say fragrance power transport imply strong sense place salty ocean lush forest flowerfille meadow oliver cos hypnotic resina hand transport wearer not different place also different time sultry mystical forest ancient miraculous commonplace beauty wisdom inextricably intertwine opening attentioncatche burst ginger star anise resina quickly fills opulent accord precious wood resin tolu balsalm elemi frankincense myrrh labdanum subtle undercurrent coffee jasmine sensation explore earthy mistfille forest brim ancestral knowledge spicy without hint stuffiness rich woody not least bit sweet resina reveal secret prove truly worthy
vetiverus eau de parfum,Oliver & Co.," If you love the pure, smoky sexiness of vetiver the way we do, it can be frustrating to try fragrances that hide it behind other powerful ingredients in the name ofbalance. Vetiverus most certainly does not have this problem. By selecting complementary notes that almost entirely accentuate and highlight the sweet earthiness of the namesake ingredient, Oliver & Co. have bucked tradition yet again with that rare vetiver fragrance that proudly refuses to apologize for being a vetiver. In keeping with this philosophy, Vetiverus opens dramatically with an exquisitely deep and mysterious vetiver, at once smoky and velvety rich, reminiscent of Les Nez's cult classic Turtle Vetiver Exercise 1. And rather than undercut that raw power, Vetiverus goes all in, with labdanum, leather, patchouli and clove serving to reinforce and extend the natural depth and warmth. A base of musk keeps everything standing upright, while the subtle sweetness of osmanthus flowers provides rich smoothness. Plenty of great fragrances feature vetiver. But for the true vetiver enthusiast searching for an unapologetic, uncompromising showcase of the sublimely smoky, there is perhaps no substitute for Vetiverus."," Labdanum, styrax, vetiver, ambergris, osmanthus flower, orange peel, patchouly, musk, coriander seed, clove bud.",love pure smoky sexiness vetiver way frustrating try fragrance hide behind powerful ingredient name ofbalance vetiverus certainly not problem select complementary note almost entirely accentuate highlight sweet earthiness namesake ingredient oliver co buck tradition yet rare vetiver fragrance proudly refuse apologize vetiver keep philosophy vetiverus open dramatically exquisitely deep mysterious vetiver smoky velvety rich reminiscent les nezs cult classic turtle vetiver exercise 1 rather undercut raw power vetiverus go labdanum leather patchouli clove serve reinforce extend natural depth warmth base musk keep everything stand upright subtle sweetness osmanthus flower provide rich smoothness plenty great fragrance feature vetiver true vetiver enthusiast search unapologetic uncompromising showcase sublimely smoky perhaps no substitute vetiverus

les jeux sont faits eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," In the 1960s,  a particular kind of rogue flourished in French cinema, exemplified by actors Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura. Their natural habitat was the smoky gambling den, the atmosphere thick with vice and retro masculinity. With Jovoy's woody aromatic perfume Les Jeux Sont Faits (The Bets Have Been Placed), FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin wanted to pay homage to those louche and romantic icons that marked an era. English gin clinking in a tumbler with ice  aromatic, fresh, and cold  is evoked by the astringent herb angelica as Les Jeux Sont Faits sounds its first notes. Its juniper-like sharpness gives way to accords that recall the woodwork, leather chairs, and gaming men in clandestine gambling clubs: tobacco leaves, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli and leather. To offset these olfactory signifiers of masculinity is a warm and fruity accord rounded off by vanilla and labdanum, which also recalls Old Cuban rums.As it dries down, Les Jeux Sont Faits' balance of herby petitgrain, boozy accords, woods and spice warmed with vanillic notes makes for one sexy scent you can bet on: this one's a winner."," Petitgrain, angelica, dried fruits, rum, gin, tobacco leaf, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum.",1960s particular kind rogue flourish french cinema exemplify actor jean gabin lino ventura natural habitat smoky gambling den atmosphere thick vice retro masculinity jovoy woody aromatic perfume les jeux sont fait bet place franaois hanin want pay homage louche romantic icon mark era english gin clinking tumbler ice aromatic fresh cold evoke astringent herb angelica les jeux sont fait sound first note juniperlike sharpness give way accord recall woodwork leather chair game man clandestine gambling club tobacco leave cumin sandalwood patchouli leather offset olfactory signifier masculinity warm fruity accord round vanilla labdanum also recall old cuban rums dry les jeux sont fait balance herby petitgrain boozy accord wood spice warm vanillic note make one sexy scent bet one winner

The melancholy of old stone walls and the richness of ancient tapestry. Shadows and whispers and held glances. The troubling thrill of obsession.

Connoisseurs of leather scents will want to flock to this brooding yet seductive perfume. A vetiver leather dosed with patchouli and papyrus sedge, followed by a creamy, woodsy base, Private Label is bone dry and only lightly sweetened yet soft and seductive.

la liturgie des heures eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," Combining the sacred and the profane, La Liturgie des Heures opens the doors of an old country cathedral, infusing the scent of burning incense with lush forest greens. The fragrant, smoky aridity of incense balanced by the rich verdancy of cypress, creates a scent at once voluptuous, mysterious, and meditative. Liturgy of the Hours' warm, resinous base embraces its incense and aromatic greens, softening their intensity and adding an element of seduction."," Cypress, incense, olibanum, cistus, myrrh, musk",combine sacred profane la liturgie des heure open door old country cathedral infuse scent burn incense lush forest greens fragrant smoky aridity incense balance rich verdancy cypress create scent voluptuous mysterious meditative liturgy hour warm resinous base embrace incense aromatic greens soften intensity add element seduction
psychedelique eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," PsychÃ©dÃ©lique,  Jovoy's magnificent ambered patchouli,  largely stays in the shadows,  meditating on the synergies between a cocoa-like amber and an inky-dark patchouli,  although rose and geranium offer a touch of freshness to its earthy sexiness.The synaesthete might say that on the olfactory color wheel,  patchouli resides somewhere between black and chocolate brown,  with a bit of iridescent chartreuse green shimmering in between. Camphory,  inky,  aromatic,  and even darkly refreshing,  the elegant patchouli in PsychÃ©dÃ©lique isdark,  smoky,  ambered,  generous and opulent,  says FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin,  and in spite of its unfortunate branding given by unwashed hippies 1960s,  he says of this perfume thatEven the mud of Woodstock won't wash it away.PsychÃ©dÃ©lique is like an olfactory Mark Rothko painting that explores the gradations between dark colors  in this case,  patchouli,  amber,  and musk. Darkly seductive and even comforting,  you might even call it 50 Shades of Black."," Citrus, rose, geranium, amber, patchouli, cistus labdanum, vanilla, musk",psychadalique jovoy magnificent ambere patchouli largely stay shadow meditating synergy cocoalike amber inkydark patchouli although rise geranium offer touch freshness earthy sexiness synaesthete may say olfactory color wheel patchouli reside somewhere black chocolate brown bit iridescent chartreuse green shimmering camphory inky aromatic even darkly refreshing elegant patchouli psychadalique isdark smoky ambere generous opulent say franaois hanin spite unfortunate brand give unwashed hippies 1960s say perfume thateven mud woodstock not wash away psychadalique like olfactory mark rothko painting explore gradation dark color case patchouli amber musk darkly seductive even comfort may even call 50 shade black
ambre premier eau de parfum,Jovoy Paris," An amber perfume with an edge,  Ambre Premier gets a dark and glittering dose of patchouli added to what FranÃ§ois HÃ©nin callsits almost childish first notes that evoke cotton candy,  and maybe even a bit of chocolate. The rose in Ambre Premier peeks through in subtle counterpoint to its more gourmand personality,  adding a freshness and elegance that balances out its confectionary proclivities.  Spicy yet delicate,  candied yet elegant and grown-up,  Ambre Premier is an amber with many dimensions."," Candied orange, rose, patchouli, amber, vanilla",amber perfume edge ambre premier get dark glitter dose patchouli add franaois hanin callsit almost childish first note evoke cotton candy maybe even bit chocolate rise ambre premier peeks subtle counterpoint gourmand personality add freshness elegance balance confectionary proclivity spicy yet delicate candy yet elegant grownup ambre premier amber many dimension
flash back eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," Straying ever-so-slightly from the brand's concept, the fragrance takes its name from film rather than photography. But thenflashback makes sense at every level. The picture that inspired it, a dream-like screen capture of a video shot by Laurent Segretier, is the face of his long-distance girlfriend (a print of the image is included in the box). The perfumer who composed it, Olivier Cresp, had worked with the brand owner CÃ©line Verleure back in 1996 on L'Eau par Kenzo for women and for men, in her previous life as a top-flight project manager in the perfume industry. As for the scent, it is Olivier Cresp's own version of a flashback, a childhood memory he'd long wanted to use as a springboard for inspiration: rhubarb pie.But though the master perfumer pegs himself asfigurative, don't expect a photorealistic impression of the homemade dessert. Flashback plays on the tart, green, citrusy aspects of rhubarb. Once unfolded, these facets connect with a bright, joyful vetiver whose grapefruit-like top notes are enhanced by actual grapefruit, before whispering the barest hint of flint and smoke.As luminous as a late spring afternoon in Cresp's native Grasse, as exhilarating as remembering a loved one's face. After all, isn't the charm of fragrance the way it materializes our memories?"," Rhubarb, grapefruit, orange, pink pepper, Granny Smith apple, vetiver, cedar, amber, musks.",stray eversoslightly brand concept fragrance take name film rather photography thenflashback make sense every level picture inspire dreamlike screen capture video shoot laurent segreti face longdistance girlfriend print image include box perfumer compose olivi cresp work brand owner caline verleure back 1996 leau par kenzo woman man previous life topflight project manager perfume industry scent olivi cresp version flashback childhood memory would long want use springboard inspiration rhubarb pie though master perfumer pegs asfigurative not expect photorealistic impression homemade dessert flashback play tart green citrusy aspect rhubarb unfolded facet connect bright joyful vetiver whose grapefruitlike top note enhance actual grapefruit whisper bare hint flint smoke luminous late spring afternoon cresp native grasse exhilarate remember love one face not charm fragrance way materialize memories
lumiere blanche eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," Picture a chalk cliff looming over a sea as still and metallic as mercury under a blazing sun... This is the picture selected by the renowned Italian photographer Massimo Vitali  whose work has been exhibited in major museums like the Guggenheim  as a brief for LumiÃ¨re Blanche (i.e.white light).To translate this concept of whiteness, but also the heat of the sun and the coolness of the sea, Sidonie Lancesseur has similarly played on olfactory contrasts. Coolness? A brace of cold spices like cardamom and star anise. Heat? The burn of cinnamon.  This spicy cocktail livens up a soothing, creamy blend of almond milk, sandalwood and tonka bean: the almond and sandalwood produce skin-loving milky effects, while the almond and tonka bean pick up on the licorice-y facets of the star anise.

autoportrait eau de parfum,Olfactive Studio," You'd think a photographer asked for a self-portrait would supply his likeness.

flower of immortality eau de parfum,By Kilian," With Flower of Immortality, Kilian pays homage to the Chinese taleA Tale of the Fountain of the Peach Blossom Spring. It is recounted that a fisherman from Wu Ling loses his way along a stream and, unexpectedly, finds himself rowing alongside a lush peach tree forest. He decides to explore further and, at the end of the forest, lands at the fountainhead of the stream. There, he disembarks and just steps beyond, discovers a haven of peace, a utopian paradise where people live apart from the exterior world. For Kilian, Flower of Immortality is, above all, an olfactory homage to the peach blossom and its very strong symbolism in China. This blossom, whose pink petals are unveiled only in the middle of the winter, is believed to have the power to bewitch the human soul and to make it immortal. It is the set of symbols and myths that surround the flower that Kilian wanted to recreate in this new fragrance.Flower of Immortality was composed as the memory of the utopian paradise, where the fragrance of peach blossoms brings a promise of hospitality and immortality. The smooth and juicy scent of White Peach, interweaved by the sweet and powdery notes of Carrot and Iris. A dazzling breeze of Blackcurrant Bud absolute refreshes while the exquisite Rose Crystal is softened by the Tonka Bean and the scent of Vanilla beans drying in the sun."," White peach, blackcurrant bud, freesia, iris, rose crystal, vanilla, tonka bean, white musk.",flower immortality kilian pays homage chinese talea tale fountain peach blossom spring recount fisherman wu ling lose way along stream unexpectedly find row alongside lush peach tree forest decide explore end forest land fountainhead stream disembarks step beyond discover peace utopian paradise people live apart exterior world kilian flower immortality olfactory homage peach blossom strong symbolism china blossom whose pink petal unveil middle winter believe power bewitch human soul make immortal set symbol myth surround flower kilian want recreate new fragrance flower immortality compose memory utopian paradise fragrance peach blossom bring promise hospitality immortality smooth juicy scent white peach interweave sweet powdery note carrot iris dazzle breeze blackcurrant bud absolute refreshe exquisite rise crystal soften tonka bean scent vanilla bean drying sun
oud 27 eau de parfum,Le Labo," The first new worldwide fragrance since Le Labo was created, Oud 27 uses its title note as a point of departure into the richly ornamented, dark and luscious world of oriental perfumes, weaving a story so multi-faceted and vivid that it might be an olfactory equivalent of one of Scheherazade's tales. The vibrant darkness falls with the very first accord, an extravagantly opulent mix of Atlas cedar and incense. The dry, resinous blend is brightened and softly sweetened by saffron, the golden spiciness of which glistens within the nocturnal fabric of Oud 27 like a constellation of far away stars. Gaiac and patchouli further deepen and enrich the balsamic top notes and lead the scent into an even more sensual territory. At once expansive and wild,  yet surprisingly intimate and soft, the scent is beautifully androgynous and would befit both Scheherazade and Shahryar. The creators call Oud 27, One Thousand and One Nights, bottled. We are so mesmerized by this oriental masterpiece that we would wear it for one thousand and one nights in a row and not miss another perfume.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

patchouli 24 eau de parfum,Le Labo," Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception.

enchanted forest eau de parfum,The Vagabond Prince," Enchanted Forest is inspired by the endless sea of Russian forests and fairytales, as well as the most sensual ancient Slavic celebration named Kupala, rooted in the times of darkness, when all on the Earth knew its soul and its name (often too powerful to be uttered in vain or at all). French perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, the famous creator of fragrances for L'Artisan Parfumeur, Comme des GarÃ§ons and Penhaligon's, built Enchanted Forest around black currant, the smell and taste of which are so beloved in Russia and many other countries where it grows.The challenge was great: I had to magnify the raw material (blackcurrant), a material used very often in perfumery and sometimes overused inelegantly through notes of red fruits, and in this regard I made a sort of soliflore. Soliflores are generally constructed on floral bases such as jasmine, rose, tuberose, but for Enchanted Forest the intention was quite different... and I had the idea of working the blackcurrant throughout the structure (head, heart, bottom) of the perfume. To do this, I used no less than a blackcurrant CO2 (an extract obtained directly from the blackcurrant buds, which is free of solvent residues), an absolute of blackcurrant and two different blackcurrant bases, including one of my own creation, to build a sort of skeleton, a vertical structure on which the entire perfume would be built.  Bertrand Duchaufour"," pink pepper, aldehydes, sweet orange, flower cassis, blackcurrant leaf, hawthorn, effects of rum and wine, rosemary, davana, blackcurrant buds absolute, CO2 blackcurrant, Russian coriander seed, honeysuckle, rose, carnation, vetiverm, opoponax, Siam benzoin, amber, oakmoss, fir balsam absolute, patchouli, castoreum, cedar notes, vanilla, musk.",enchant forest inspire endless sea russian forest fairytale well sensual ancient slavic celebration name kupala root time darkness earth know soul name often powerful uttered vain french perfumer bertrand duchaufour famous creator fragrance lartisan parfumeur comme des garaon penhaligon build enchant forest around black currant smell taste beloved russia many country grow challenge great magnify raw material blackcurrant material use often perfumery sometimes overuse inelegantly note red fruit regard make sort soliflore soliflore generally construct floral basis jasmine rise tuberose enchant forest intention quite different idea work blackcurrant throughout structure head heart bottom perfume use no less blackcurrant co2 extract obtain directly blackcurrant bud free solvent residues absolute blackcurrant two different blackcurrant basis include one creation build sort skeleton vertical structure entire perfume would build bertrand duchaufour

If she did decide to show, she'd kick down the door in a low cut dress and demand a man and a martini.Beginning with a tinge of berry sweetness that draws you in before it's too late, Rosae Mundi is a luscious and uncompromising beauty. She brings to the imagination a spontaneous trip to Venice and a night sloshed with wine and wilting roses. Rosae Mundi, or Rose of the World,  is a compilation of rose and earth - vetiver, patchouli, and cedar lend the rich and downy chaise upon which the divine rose curls. As the scent develops, these earthly pleasures divulge their secrets on the skin - complimenting one another beautifully. It seems as though this rose has been everywhere and seen everything, and yet still rises (though not too early, let's not push it) with a curiosity and eagerness to see what the new day holds."," Rose, patchouli, vetiver, cedar",sometimes rise fragrance take quiet docile path blush giggle innocent soapy freshness classic traditional safe bet loyal friend rosae mundi not rise fragrance prefer not show boring party decide show would kick door low cut dress demand man martini begin tinge berry sweetness draws late rosae mundi luscious uncompromising beauty bring imagination spontaneous trip venice night slosh wine wilt rose rosae mundi rise world compilation rise earth vetiver patchouli cedar lend rich downy chaise upon divine rise curls scent develop earthly pleasure divulge secret skin compliment one another beautifully seem though rise everywhere see everything yet still rise though not early let us not push curiosity eagerness see new day hold

The opening is especially evocative of another time and it is pure swank  like an expensive gift from a rich suitor, conjuring up images of mirror-topped vanities and red lipstick. This develops into an opulent floral featuring luminous gardenia, heady tuberose, piercing jasmine, and velvety rose. The mix is full and lush and there is the seductive thrum of cedar wood underneath it all. You might guess that the lilac and heliotrope would be overwhelmed by all of this and just sit off to the side and whisper to each other  but they are beautifully present, adding delicacy and charm as they put the twinkle in our saucy heroine's eye.

s-ex eau de parfum,S-Perfume," S-ex (pronouncedes-ex) isn't another avant-garde perfume that claims, in flowery prose, to be the perfume representation of sweaty sheets.

fils de dieu eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The tagline for this Fils de Dieu, du Riz et des Agrumes (Son of God, rice and citrus isHe brings the sunshine). But despite these distinctly religious references, there is nary a tear of incense in Ralf Schwieger's dÃ©but scent for Ãtat Libre d'Orange. And despite a list of notes that almost reads like the recipe for a South-eastern Asian dish, Fils de Dieu never veers into the foody: rather, it shows how the aromas lacing one of the most refined cuisines in the world are also perfumes. The green, citrusy top notes add sparkle to the cardamom and ginger, churning up the milky, powdery accents of the rice and coconut notes. The latter is picked up by the lactonic facets in jasmine, while a rich May rose hints that the Queen of flowers and steamed rice may have secret affinities.Then as it moves into the drydown, Fils de Dieu reveals its animal nature by exhaling a soft, dark leather note, more suede than rawhide, infused with musk. And we sing Hallelujah."," Ginger, coriander leaves, lime, shiso, bergamot, Jungle Essence coconut, rice note, Jungle Essence cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, French May rose, tonka bean, vetiver, musk, amber, leather, castoreum.",tagline fils de dieu du riz et des agrume son god rice citrus ishe bring sunshine despite distinctly religious reference nary tear incense ralf schwieger dabut scent atat libre dorange despite list note almost reads like recipe southeastern asian dish fils de dieu never veer foody rather show aromas lace one refined cuisines world also perfumes green citrusy top note add sparkle cardamom ginger churn milky powdery accent rice coconut note latter pick lactonic facet jasmine rich may rise hint queen flower steamed rice may secret affinity move drydown fils de dieu reveal animal nature exhale soft dark leather note suede rawhide infuse musk sing hallelujah
bijou romantique eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," The name comes from a line said by Hugo Pratt's cult graphic novel hero, the half-gypsy sailor Corto Maltese, in The Ballad of the Salt Sea:Adieu, bijou romantique (Farewell, romantic jewel). The tagline,Her price is far above rubies, is drawn from the Scriptures.As for the scent, it is by Mathilde Bijaoui, whose dark beauty would have surely inspired Hugo Pratt had he known her. It was Mathilde who signed the critically acclaimed Tilda Swinton Like This, and with Bijou Romantique she offers another delicately hued composition that hovers just on the edge of being the most ethereal gourmand, with the subtle chocolate facets of iris, vetiver blending into the creaminess of vanilla and benzoin. Laboratoire Mane's captive molecule EVEE bridges the gap between vanilla and spices, lightly brushing the blend with the burn of clove.Tender, complex and multi-facetted, Bijou Romantique lives up to its name.

precious oud eau de parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," In 2009, Van Cleef & Arpels Haute Parfumerie stepped out with a range sublimating emblematic essences. That is how Collection Extraordinaire, a range of monofloral compositions and a cologne, came about. Today, a new chapter has been added to this wonderful story. Following on from the great classics, the timeless foundations of the collection, afree form piece glorifying Oud essence has been created.The new opus, Precious Oud, pays homage to a mythical essence. The aquilaria, an Asian or Indian tree, actually only reveals its powerful scent via the infection of the wood by a fungus. A magi-like essence alongside frankincense and myrrh, the fragrant Oud resin, woody and balsamic, adds earthy and leathery accents. The perfumer Amandine Marie has chosen to interpret Oud essence and associate it with flowers. The top note is bright and sparkling bergamot set off with pink peppercorn whilst already hinting at the tonality of the perfume with the scent of opulent incense. The heart note is a vibrant bouquet of the most beautiful flowers - sensual jasmine accompanied by tuberose. If not the queen of perfumery, then the tuberose could very well be the empress with its bewitching, divinely heady scent. There is a woody note of patchouli, and the base notes open up, opulent, rich and precious, surrounding the mythical Oud with the woody notes of sandalwood and vetiver and enveloping it in accents of amber.With its warm and sensual sillage, Precious Oud embodies the new opus of Collection Extraordinaire. A perfume with character, it has paved the way for new inspiration, totally free art where only the most noble, precious materials are given pride of place and the guiding principle is excellence."," bergamot, pink pepper, incense, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, oud, sandalwood, vetiver and ambergris",2009 van cleef arpel haute parfumerie step range sublimating emblematic essence collection extraordinaire range monofloral composition cologne come today new chapter add wonderful story follow great classic timeless foundation collection afree form piece glorify oud essence create new opus precious oud pays homage mythical essence aquilaria asian indian tree actually reveal powerful scent via infection wood fungus magilike essence alongside frankincense myrrh fragrant oud resin woody balsamic add earthy leathery accent perfumer amandine marie choose interpret oud essence associate flower top note bright sparkle bergamot set pink peppercorn whilst already hinting tonality perfume scent opulent incense heart note vibrant bouquet beautiful flower sensual jasmine accompany tuberose not queen perfumery tuberose could well empress bewitching divinely heady scent woody note patchouli base note open opulent rich precious surround mythical oud woody note sandalwood vetiver envelop accent amber warm sensual sillage precious oud embodie new opus collection extraordinaire perfume character pave way new inspiration totally free art noble precious material give pride place guide principle excellence
what we do in paris is secret eau de parfum,A Lab on Fire," You know how the notes in some perfumes read like something from your wildest, fragrant dreams but end up smelling like a Franken-fume, something you should love but don't, something that's less than the sum of its parts? What We Do In Paris Is Secret actually exceeds the gorgeous sounding symphony of its notes (and that's a hard thing to do!). It's impossible not to be lured in by the rich, sweet notes of vanilla, honey, tonka bean and tolu, the warm sensuality of sandalwood, musks, ambergris, and the playful Turkish rose, lychee and bergamot.

Not in thatYou're leaving a vapor trail! way, but in that,Please tell me what you're wearing now! way. Creamy, decadent, honeyed and sensual.

sombre negra eau de parfum,YOSH," Sombre Negra, or black shadow, is the debut scent in the newM Series by San Francisco perfumer, Yosh Han. Highly sought after for her exclusive custom fragrances, Han says,TheM series is a departure from the ethereal quality of my previous collections and explores fragrances that evoke our deepest nature.Sombre Negra is a double agent. Intelligent, beguiling, captivating. The man who wears Sombre Negra is not what he seems. He is elegant and forbidden. His presence is undeniable but he can vanish without a trace. The woman who wears Sombre Negra is a smoldering beauty. Highly perceptive and discerning, she knows more than she lets on. She sees beyond the shadows, without fear of the unknown.Please note, this is a newly re-imagined Sombre Negra.Perfumer Notes: I launched a Limited Edition Sombre Negra exclusively with LuckyScent in 2010. That fragrance to me was dark and edgy. Very dense. I wanted to explore the idea of shadows and their mutations so I decided to create a new edition of Sombre Negra. The new M:001 Sombre Negra incorporates citrus top notes that reflect a flash of lightning - a spark of fire that quickly vanishes but casts new and elongated shadows. Rose, tonka and orris were added to give it some depth and fullness. Nutmeg and cumin give the fragrance a kind of vegetative musk and suede element to an otherwise smokey and leathery fragrance. It is still very masculine but Sombre Negra is also the 'boyfriend fragrance' that women are falling in love with and keeping for themselves."," Vetiver, patchouli, cedar, olibanum, pink pepperberry and black peppercorn, clove, juniper, citrus, nutmeg, cumin, tonka and orris root",sombre negra black shadow debut scent newm series san francisco perfumer yosh han highly seek exclusive custom fragrance han saysthem series departure ethereal quality previous collection explore fragrance evoke deep nature sombre negra double agent intelligent beguile captivate man wear sombre negra not seem elegant forbid presence undeniable vanish without trace woman wear sombre negra smoldering beauty highly perceptive discern know lets see beyond shadow without fear unknown please note newly reimagine sombre negraperfumer note launch limited edition sombre negra exclusively luckyscent 2010 fragrance dark edgy dense want explore idea shadow mutation decide create new edition sombre negra new m001 sombre negra incorporates citrus top note reflect flash lightning spark fire quickly vanishe casts new elongate shadow rise tonka orris add give depth fullness nutmeg cumin give fragrance kind vegetative musk suede element otherwise smokey leathery fragrance still masculine sombre negra also boyfriend fragrance woman fall love keep

While this formulation Geisha Rouge is warm, beckoning, enticing. Its blend of tonka bean, tobacco and vanilla, combined with cinnamon, star of anise, clove, and sandalwood traditional Japanese incense ingredients are still in their original proportions, the added presence of alcohol serves to lighten it up and give it some breathing space.

dolce acqua eau de parfum,Profumum," If you know the Profumum line, you may have noticed that they often involve a bit of a journey. We generally start with where they begin, but this time we'll start with where Dolce Acqua ends: a room where cookies have been baking all day. Vanilla, almond and coconut in a doughy blend with a flourish of powdered sugar and that hint of cherry that we associate with heliotrope. There is also a little something cool in the mix that we can't quite put our fingers on  balsam-like and airy. There is a nostalgic quality  a hint of beloved childhood confections that melt on the tongue. Testing it on three generations, they each recalled a different beloved treat  so we can't say it resembles a particular delicacy as much as it evokes the memories of someone baking your favorite thing for you. So, if you end up with a dreamy vanilla almond fluffery that coddles and soothes, where do you begin? With a boisterous and boozy caramel-like vanilla with a pronounced swirl of almond, which then takes a fascinating detour into something mysteriously reminiscent of beeswax, before it arrives at its soft and comforting destination."," Coconut, heliotrope, almond, vanilla, tonka bean",know profumum line may notice often involve bit journey generally start begin time start dolce acqua ends room cookie baking day vanilla almond coconut doughy blend flourish powder sugar hint cherry associate heliotrope also little something cool mix not quite put finger balsamlike airy nostalgic quality hint beloved childhood confection melt tongue testing three generation recall different beloved treat not say resemble particular delicacy much evoke memories someone baking favorite thing end dreamy vanilla almond fluffery coddles soothes begin boisterous boozy caramellike vanilla pronounce swirl almond take fascinating detour something mysteriously reminiscent beeswax arrive soft comfort destination

honour man eau de parfum,Amouage," Honour Man, the regal, dramatic masculine fragrance with a spicy, woody character, is heir to Amouage's ongoing (soap) operatic narrative that began with Jubilation, and continued on with Lyric, Epic, and Memoir.With an intensely peppery, dark opening, Honour Man creates olfactory storm clouds of disquiet, confusion, and drama befitting its back story, which was written by the perfume house's creative director Christopher Chong and inspired by Puccini's tragic opera Madame Butterfly.In Chong's melodramatic creative brief, Honour is the son of Madame Butterfly, Puccini's tragic heroine who commits suicide when the American soldier who abandoned her years before returns to take their son. Honour has come back, so the narrative goes, to confront his mother's tragedy and to come to terms with his identity.After the blast of pepper, Honour Man allows a fresh, rosy-floral note from geranium to peek through the dark clouds, followed by a succession of warm, woody, and spicy notes, including an intense patchouli that reminds us that Honour is still a fiery young man. Chong suggests that these comforting, beautifully blended base notes represent the reconciliation of our hero's troubled quest with hisfilial elegy to honour his mother. Its dry down does indeed feel like the denouement to a stormy, existential drama. Honour Man is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal."," Pink pepper, black pepper, geranium, elemi, nutmeg, patchouli, frankincense, cedarwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",honour man regal dramatic masculine fragrance spicy woody character heir amouage ongoing soap operatic narrative begin jubilation continue lyric epic memoir intensely peppery dark opening honour man create olfactory storm cloud disquiet confusion drama befitting back story write perfume house creative director christopher chong inspire puccinis tragic opera madame butterfly chongs melodramatic creative brief honour son madame butterfly puccinis tragic heroine commit suicide american soldier abandon year return take son honour come back narrative go confront mother tragedy come term identity blast pepper honour man allow fresh rosyfloral note geranium peek dark cloud follow succession warm woody spicy note include intense patchouli remind us honour still fiery young man chong suggest comfort beautifully blend base note represent reconciliation heros trouble quest hisfilial elegy honour mother dry indeed feel like denouement stormy existential drama honour man house white crystal bottle goldplate cap affixed white opal svarovski crystal
honour woman eau de parfum,Amouage," Inspired by Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly,  Amouage Honour Woman is a delicate and even emotional rendition of white florals. (How could it not be emotional when it's based on the story of a heroine who kills herself when the American soldier she's pined for returns to her homeland to take their child?)Death with honour,  proclaims the heroine before dying, when one can no longer live in honour.Honour Woman opens with a tart rhubarb note and ends on a smooth base of subtly spicy resins,  amber and almost imperceptible leather. But the showstopper of Honour Woman is its floral heart. Gardenia,  which is often deployed to bring out its hot-house flower sultriness,  is here transparent and light,  flanked like a princess in white with her attendants lily-of-the-valley,  jasmine,  carnation and a very subdued tuberose. It's as if the passionate gardenia that Madame Butterfly's Cio Cio San once was gives way,  after Pinkerton's betrayal,  to a more stoic and elegant  if tragic  version of the flower. Eros transformed into Thanatos.As it dries down,  traces of rhubarb remain as its subtly spicy and warm base rises up. Even without the perfume's melodramatic back story,  Honour Woman's fragrant narrative is powerful on its own.Honour Woman is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal."," Pepper, rhubarb, coriander, jasmine, tuberose, gardenia, lily of the valley, carnation, vetiver, frankincense, amber, opoponax, leather",inspire puccinis opera madame butterfly amouage honour woman delicate even emotional rendition white floral could not emotional base story heroine kill american soldier pine return homeland take childdeath honour proclaim heroine die one no long live honour honour woman open tart rhubarb note ends smooth base subtly spicy resin amber almost imperceptible leather showstopper honour woman floral heart gardenia often deploy bring hothouse flower sultriness transparent light flank like princess white attendant lilyofthevalley jasmine carnation subdue tuberose passionate gardenia madame butterflys cio cio san give way pinkerton betrayal stoic elegant tragic version flower eros transform thanatos dry trace rhubarb remain subtly spicy warm base rise even without perfumes melodramatic back story honour womans fragrant narrative powerful honour woman house white crystal bottle goldplate cap affixed white opal svarovski crystal
oudh osmanthus eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," A lot of different perfumes called Oud claim they contain real oud. But what is important to know and to understand about this phenomenon is that most of them contain a synthetic base which reproduces the scent of oud and not the essential oil of oud itself which is very different. Mme Mona di Orio has studied both of them and the aura, the intensity, the beauty, the depth of the natural one is so fantastic, so magical, so mysterious and complex compared to the synthetic one which is simply a nice woody, leathery, spicy base without any vibration or any mystery.The first time Mme Di Orio smelt a sample of an oud essential oil, she was not at all convinced. There are many different qualities and origins, and as she was not seduced, she was not really interested to work with it. Last year her provider called her he just had received a new quality from Laos and this time when she smelt it, she was totally subjugated, intoxicated. Such an aura, such an essential oil, at this moment Mme Di Orio realized deeply why this product was so mystical, intimate and secret for thousands of years and through many religions in the world. Just to give an idea about its value: 18,000 Euro for one kilo-- about half a kilo compared to the price of gold.  She wanted to create something unique and thought about blending oud with somethimg rare and also precious, really different and unexpected like the absolute osmanthus from China. Created from a real oud essential oil, distilled by traditional hand methods in Laos; the source of oud is from a tree that has been replanted and cultivated under fair trade practices.The enigmatic and much-prized essential oil of real Oudh from Laos radiates from the centre of Mona di Orio'sOud casting a mystical spell on the other notes and highlighting their beauty. This fragrance opens with notes of hesperides and spices like elemi, petitgrain and green mandarin, mingled in a seductive encounter. Like a love potion with a radiant sensuality, the Oudh reveals one by one its troubling facets, alternated between animal, leathery, woody or balsamic. They embrace in a passionate vibration to a shadowy patchouli, a mysterious nagarmotha, a cedar from Atlas and a grey amber, a spellbinding formula rich and headily. Absolu osmanthus, the carnal flower with its warm mesmeric charming hints of jasmin, honey and apricot tempers the forceful power of the Oudh by its gourmand nectar.Please note: Oudh Osmanthus is the same fragrance formerly know as ""Oud""."," Elimi Phillipines, Green Mandarin from Calabre, Petitgrain Paraguay, Patchouli Indonesia, Absolu Osmanthus China, Nagarmotha India, Cedarwood from Atlas, Essential Oil Oudh Laos, Musc, Amber Gris",lot different perfumes call oud claim contain real oud important know understand phenomenon contain synthetic base reproduce scent oud not essential oil oud different mme mona di orio study aura intensity beauty depth natural one fantastic magical mysterious complex compare synthetic one simply nice woody leathery spicy base without vibration mystery first time mme di orio smelt sample oud essential oil not convinced many different quality origin not seduce not really interested work last year provider call receive new quality laos time smelt totally subjugate intoxicate aura essential oil moment mme di orio realize deeply product mystical intimate secret thousand year many religion world give idea value 18000 euro one kilo half kilo compare price gold want create something unique think blending oud somethimg rare also precious really different unexpected like absolute osmanthus china create real oud essential oil distil traditional hand method laos source oud tree replanted cultivate fair trade practice enigmatic muchprize essential oil real oudh laos radiates centre mona di oriosoud cast mystical spell note highlight beauty fragrance open note hesperide spice like elemi petitgrain green mandarin mingle seductive encounter like love potion radiant sensuality oudh reveal one one troubling facet alternate animal leathery woody balsamic embrace passionate vibration shadowy patchouli mysterious nagarmotha cedar atlas grey amber spellbind formula rich headily absolu osmanthus carnal flower warm mesmeric charming hint jasmin honey apricot temper forceful power oudh gourmand nectar please note oudh osmanthus fragrance formerly know oud
back to black eau de parfum - ...,By Kilian," When you call your scentaphrodisiac, you'd better be fairly sure you're not overreaching yourself. This latest release from By Kilian, is the sixth composed for the house by Calice Becker, is as head-turning a love potion as you're ever likely to spritz on. That is, if you enjoy the velvet-smooth, burning liquid umber of a great cognac and the hay-like scent of tobacco steeped in fruit and honey, or sipping a fine amaretto on a bed of moss. Who doesn't?Back to Black is an olfactory trip to Arabia  or perhaps to the exotica-mad 1920s, when Caron gave Tabac Blond to sultry, cigarette-smoking garÃ§onnes. The tobacco accord is slyly evoked through the herbal, faintly animalic scent of chamomile laced with honey; the honey in its turn conjures faintly floral aromas. Throughout its development, Back to Black runs through a palette of subtly gourmand flavors, from ripe, almost fermented raspberry to the dry cocoa powder of patchouli, along with almond and vanilla, without ever veering into tooth-aching sweetness thanks to the bitter, cooling effect of cardamom, coriander, vetiver and moss.  It stretches out languorously on the skin for hours, displaying its dark facets, leaving you hungry for more Arabian nights in its amber glow."," Bergamot, raspberry, blue chamomile, cardamom, coriander, saffron, cedarwood, vanilla, almond, vetiver, cistus labdanum, patchouli, oakmoss.",call scentaphrodisiac would well fairly sure not overreach late release kilian sixth compose house calice becker headturne love potion ever likely spritz enjoy velvetsmooth burn liquid umber great cognac haylike scent tobacco steep fruit honey sip fine amaretto bed moss not back black olfactory trip arabia perhaps exoticamad 1920s caron give tabac blond sultry cigarettesmoke garaonne tobacco accord slyly evoke herbal faintly animalic scent chamomile lace honey honey turn conjure faintly floral aromas throughout development back black run palette subtly gourmand flavor ripe almost ferment raspberry dry cocoa powder patchouli along almond vanilla without ever veer toothaching sweetness thanks bitter cool effect cardamom coriander vetiver moss stretch languorously skin hour display dark facet leave hungry arabian night amber glow

black jade eau de parfum,Lubin," Marie Antoinette, the infamous young queen of France -- initially loved by the people for her charm and beauty, she became an international symbol of decadent luxury. Naturally her court had a royal perfumer, Jean-Louis Fargeon, and, naturally, he created an opulent, no-expenses-spared fragrance exclusively for her. Inspired by her rose-filled garden at Le Petit Trianon, this mysterious concoction was kept in a black jade flask which the queen kept with her at all times. Luckily for us, the perfumer had a young apprentice, Pierre Lubin, who paid closer attention to the formula for this elixir than perhaps he should have. Known in the House of Lubin for years asjardin secret, the formula has been newly revived with the help of one of Marie's black jade bottles that had been hidden away by a confidante. Fittingly, it is now known as Black Jade.Yes, yes, you say, thanks for the history lesson and all, but what is the juice itself like? Rich. Seductive. Alluring. As deliciously extravagant as you would expect from a queen notorious for her lavish tastes. This was a tribute to her beloved garden, so of course there are flowers, but this is no simple, country garden. These are flowers for royalty. Lush, satiny roses and frilly jasmine are embroidered with cardamom and cinnamon and exotic incense, then layered over a velvety base of patchouli, tonka bean, vanilla and amber. The opening is surprisingly cool and spicy, then as the floral heart opens and the roses bloom, it becomes warm and enticing and compelling. Exquisitely confident and unapologetically luxurious."," Galbanum, bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, incense, cinnamon, Indian sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, amber",marie antoinette infamous young queen france initially love people charm beauty become international symbol decadent luxury naturally court royal perfumer jeanlouis fargeon naturally create opulent noexpensesspare fragrance exclusively inspire rosefille garden le petit trianon mysterious concoction keep black jade flask queen keep time luckily us perfumer young apprentice pierre lubin pay close attention formula elixir perhaps know house lubin year asjardin secret formula newly revive help one mary black jade bottle hide away confidante fittingly know black jade yes yes say thanks history lesson juice like rich seductive alluring deliciously extravagant would expect queen notorious lavish taste tribute beloved garden course flower no simple country garden flower royalty lush satiny rose frilly jasmine embroider cardamom cinnamon exotic incense layered velvety base patchouli tonka bean vanilla amber opening surprisingly cool spicy floral heart open rose bloom become warm entice compelling exquisitely confident unapologetically luxurious
tubereuse - les nombres d'or eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," When we think of tuberose in perfume,  we often think of the version most perfumers like to emphasize: its nocturnal version,  when it exudes its most intense scent. More discreet and docile during the day,  the flower some callThe Queen of the Night emerges from its slumber when it's dark out to emit a deep and almost animalic aroma.In TubÃ©reuse,  Mona di Orio creates what she calls atwilight tuberose,  greener and fresher than its headier nocturnal incarnations but still intoxicating and rich. It opens with a beautiful and peppery burst of bergamot and green notes,  which almost gives tuberose the quality of having been tamed and made more transparent after a refreshing light rain.Soon,  the unmistakably narcotic tuberose slinks its way forward,  flanked by creamy notes from benzoin and amber matched with a milky nuttiness from heliotrope and coconut. Along with TubÃ©reuse's top notes,  the occasional sharp floral facet from heliotrope joins with tuberose's green facets,  balancing out its creamy and musky base notes.More approachable than its more femme fatale counterparts,  TubÃ©reuse nevertheless seduces. Perfect for tuberose fans that want a lighter,  friendlier,  more verdant interpretation of the flower."," Pink pepper, bergamot from Calabria, green leaves, Indian tuberose absolute, Siamese benzoin, heliotrope, Amber, coconut milk, musk",think tuberose perfume often think version perfumer like emphasize nocturnal version exude intense scent discreet docile day flower callthe queen night emerge slumber dark emit deep almost animalic aroma tubareuse mona di orio create call atwilight tuberose greener fresher headier nocturnal incarnation still intoxicate rich open beautiful peppery burst bergamot green note almost give tuberose quality tamed make transparent refreshing light rain soon unmistakably narcotic tuberose slink way forward flank creamy note benzoin amber match milky nuttiness heliotrope coconut along tubareuse top note occasional sharp floral facet heliotrope join tuberose green facet balance creamy musky base note approachable femme fatale counterpart tubareuse nevertheless seduce perfect tuberose fan want light friendly verdant interpretation flower
vanille - les nombres d'or eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," When composing Vanille, Mona di Orio imagined a romantic back story involving an old ship from long ago, on its way to Madagascar or the Comoros Islands, carrying precious cargo: rum barrels, oranges, vanilla beans, ylang-ylang, cloves and sandalwood.Gourmand, smoky, and boozy with a subtle aromatic orange note lingering in the background, Vanille is one Bateau Ivre of perfectly blended notes that will derange your senses with its sensuality.Vanille opens with a shot of rum flavored with an orange rind and spiced with cloves. Amber and tonka further warm up this brew as ylang-ylang's sharp sweetness joins with rich vanilla. Gaiac wood adds incensey smoke as woody notes from vetiver and sandalwood help to create an elegant finish.But the real star of the show, not surprisingly, is vanilla. Instead of using ethyl vanillin, one of vanilla's main components that can come across as powdery and sugary, Mona di Orio used pure vanilla in this elixir. For a moment  amid this elegant orchestral arrangement of notes in the key of Vanilla  the pulpy, sensual creaminess of a split vanilla bean is right there in front of your nose.

vetyver - les nombres d'or eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Vetiver is one of our favorite notes in perfume, and in Mona di Orio's VÃ©tyver, she wrests every facet she can get from its earthy-citrus scent, like a pianist exploring the intricacies of a particular key in a Bach piano concerto. Fresh, dry, peppery, hesperidic and even minty  VÃ©tyver marries the best Bourbon vetiver with notes that bring out its herbaceous-fresh qualities.In the top notes, blue ginger from Madagascar  which Mona di Orio distinguishes from what she calls the dustier and drier Chinese ginger   creates the olfactory hallucination of having the fresh root under your nose. Virginia cedar and clary sage absolute add a slightly bitter, herbaceous accord with a momentary glint of mint.VÃ©tyver then creates a sleight-of-hand impression of both dryness and freshness, like freshly steeped spiced tea with grapefruit zest just beginning to release its oils. This hesperidic note, concentrated rather than juicy and sparkling, adds a lovely counterpoint to the subtle but rich tonka and labdanum, which add weight and roundness to the perfume.Ginger and nutmeg become more prominent as the perfume progresses, and in its dry down, VÃ©tyver's paradoxical freshness and dryness linger delicately on the skin. A perfect unisex scent for warm weather, VÃ©tyver is a rarity: a clean scent that is also complex."," Blue Ginger, Grapefruit, Nutmeg, Vetyver from Bourbon, Ciste Labdanum, Musk, Patchouli, Absolute Sage.",vetiver one favorite note perfume mona di orio vatyver wrest every facet get earthycitrus scent like pianist explore intricacy particular key bach piano concerto fresh dry peppery hesperidic even minty vatyver marrie good bourbon vetiver note bring herbaceousfresh quality top note blue ginger madagascar mona di orio distinguishe call dusty drier chinese ginger create olfactory hallucination fresh root nose virginia cedar clary sage absolute add slightly bitter herbaceous accord momentary glint mint vatyver create sleightofhand impression dryness freshness like freshly steep spice tea grapefruit zest begin release oil hesperidic note concentrated rather juicy sparkle add lovely counterpoint subtle rich tonka labdanum add weight roundness perfume ginger nutmeg become prominent perfume progress dry vatyver paradoxical freshness dryness linger delicately skin perfect unisex scent warm weather vatyver rarity clean scent also complex
dark aoud eau de parfum,Montale," Experiencing Dark Aoud by Montale in its initial stages is akin to walking into a pitch-black room. Just as it takes a while for your eyes to adjust in order to discern the shapes, sizes, and nuances of the objects initially hidden in darkness, so too does it take time to realize that Dark Oud is more than a linear oud.A minimalist exploration of two powerful accords  oud and sandalwood  Dark Aoud starts out with the smoky, camphoraceous, medicinal aspect of oud on display, accompanied by a dry and elegant sandalwood. A sweeter, softer, and rounder sandalwood comes forth from its initial asceticism, rounding out the oud note's inky darkness and revealing its soft, even powdery spiciness. Although Dark Aoud gets softer through its long dry down, it remains an intense and mysterious presence on your skin."," Indian sandalwood, Oud, Black Pepper, Saffron, Vetiver, Teak, Leather, Grey Amber",experience dark aoud montale initial stage akin walk pitchblack room take eye adjust order discern shapes size nuance object initially hide darkness take time realize dark oud linear oud minimalist exploration two powerful accord oud sandalwood dark aoud start smoky camphoraceous medicinal aspect oud display accompany dry elegant sandalwood sweeter soft rounder sandalwood come forth initial asceticism round oud note inky darkness reveal soft even powdery spiciness although dark aoud get soft long dry remain intense mysterious presence skin

battito d'ali eau de parfum,Profumum," Battito d'ali meansthe beating of wings and implies an elusive, fragile quality  the delicate fluttering of a passing butterfly, or, in this case  angels hovering nearby. creating a magical fleeting moment of feeling protected and cherished and free of worries. Opening with a strong dose of myrrh, this initially seems very human - sharp and vaguely medicinal. Then the heart piercing radiance of ethereal orange blossom lifts us up and a delicate dusting of soft cocoa powder and sweet, gentle vanilla blend with the myrrh to create something heavenly. This is powdery and gorgeous  the gourmand notes are handled with a light hand and meld with the other elements without dominating them. This does not seem like eating a cake, but rather like passing by a room where many cakes have been baked and the sweetness has become part of the air itself. If you could wrap that air around you like a cozy blanket to fend off melancholy, it would be like wearing this exquisite scent.  No one knows what angels smell like, of course - and we imagine that everyone's angel would be scented differently  but the angels in our dreams will now smell like this -- dreamy, otherworldly and infinitely comforting."," Cocoa poudre, orange blossom, myrrh, vanilla",battito dali meansthe beat wing imply elusive fragile quality delicate fluttering pass butterfly case angel hover nearby create magical fleeting moment feel protect cherish free worry opening strong dose myrrh initially seem human sharp vaguely medicinal heart pierce radiance ethereal orange blossom lift us delicate dusting soft cocoa powder sweet gentle vanilla blend myrrh create something heavenly powdery gorgeous gourmand note handle light hand meld element without dominate not seem like eat cake rather like pass room many cake baked sweetness become part air could wrap air around like cozy blanket fend melancholy would like wear exquisite scent no one know angel smell like course imagine everyone angel would scent differently angel dream smell like dreamy otherworldly infinitely comfort
arso eau de parfum,Profumum," The sharp, evocative scent of wood smoke  - triggering childhood memories of bonfires and burning leaves  - is at the heart of this eloquent scent. Arso meansburned and the masterfully rendered smokiness works with the crisp cool scent of pine to conjure up a cabin in winter, with a crackling fire on the hearth. You can sense the snow piling up outside, the ice on the windowpanes, the wildness of the forest and the chill kept at bay by the blaze, but you also get the warm indoor scents of well-worn leather and glowing incense, as well as the fire.  The mood is calm and comfortable and safe  sitting with a glass of wine and good company while the winds howl outside.  This is perfectly suited for the strong, silent type - the sort of man who could build a house single-handedly and maybe even chop down the trees to build all by himself. Quiet, reassuring and powerful."," Leather, incense, pine resin, cedar leaves",sharp evocative scent wood smoke trigger childhood memories bonfire burn leave heart eloquent scent arso meansburne masterfully render smokiness work crisp cool scent pine conjure cabin winter crackle fire hearth sense snow pile outside ice windowpane wildness forest chill keep bay blaze also get warm indoor scent wellworn leather glow incense well fire mood calm comfortable safe sit glass wine good company wind howl outside perfectly suited strong silent type sort man could build house singlehandedly maybe even chop tree build quiet reassure powerful
fougere royale eau de parfum,Houbigant," First introduced in 1882, FougÃ¨re Royale completely revolutionized the world of perfumes and established modern perfumery as we know it today.

A redolent heart follows, wherein a floral-spicy ""Rondeletia"" accord is revealed through rich geranium nuances and warm spices. A floral intermezzo showcases rare rose essences and absolutes, spiked with pepper, cinnamon and carnation. Finally, a grand finale of earthy, ambery and woody harmonies, with moss notes joining a sensual patchouli theme enriched by warm coumarinic undertones of tonka beans and clary sage absolute, conclude the aromatic symphony."," Bergamot, mediterranean herbs, lavender, chamomile, rondeletia, geranium, rose de Mai, cinnamon, carnation, amber, oakmoss, patchouli, tonka bean, clary sage",first introduce 1882 fouga royale completely revolutionize world perfumes establish modern perfumery know today fouga royale firstfouga fernlike perfume ever create establish completely new fragrance family remain popular one men fragrance fouga royale open uplifting cocktail sparkle citrus oil blending aromatic bouquet mediterranean herbs lavender moroccan chamomile oil dictate buoyant tempo redolent heart follow wherein floralspicy rondeletia accord reveal rich geranium nuance warm spice floral intermezzo showcase rare rise essence absolute spike pepper cinnamon carnation finally grand finale earthy ambery woody harmony moss note join sensual patchouli theme enrich warm coumarinic undertone tonka bean clary sage absolute conclude aromatic symphony
la belle helene eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," Osmanthus is one of the most unusual floral essences in the perfumer's palette, barely a flower really, but an oddly compelling hybrid of fruit and animal with its jammy apricot and soft leather facets. And for Parfums MDCI's 10th fragrance, Bertrand Duchaufour has brought out its beauty with two lightly gourmand accords. The name comes from by the classic French dessert Pears Belle-HÃ©lÃ¨ne, invented in the late 19th century by Auguste Escoffier, the first celebrity chef and named after Offenbach's 1864 operetta, a risquÃ© spoof on the abduction of Helen of Troy.  Of the poached pears, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and crystallized violets, the perfumer has only kept the pear -- a vivid, juicy pear adding its green, rosy and musky notes to the apricot in top and heart, underlined by a zest of tangerine. The powdery woodiness of violets, another facet of osmanthus, are boosted by pure orris butter and balanced out by their classic partner, rose; ylang ylang adds contrast and a rich floral fleshiness. The leather in the osmanthus is drawn out in the heart and anchored to the base by a burnt sweet, woody licorice accord.With its drop of citrus, rose and vetiver, patchouli and oak moss base, La Belle HÃ©lÃ¨ne is also, essentially, a chypre  the third in MDCI's line-up. But it is decidedly a non-classic chypre, silky, musky, juicy and light-hearted: in fact, like its namesakethe beautiful Helen, it is quite the charmer. And like Escoffier's culinary classic, it's almost impossible not to bite into."," Pear accord, aldehydes, tangerine, lime blossom, rose essence, osmanthus absolute, ylang-ylang Madagascar, orris butter, hawthorn, Mirabelle plum, myrrh, vetiver Haiti, patchouli, cedar Virginia, amber, oak moss absolute, white musks, sandalwood, licorice wood.",osmanthus one unusual floral essence perfumer palette barely flower really oddly compelling hybrid fruit animal jammy apricot soft leather facet parfum mdcis 10th fragrance bertrand duchaufour bring beauty two lightly gourmand accord name come classic french dessert pear bellehala ne invent late 19th century auguste escoffier first celebrity chef name offenbachs 1864 operetta risqua spoof abduction helen troy poach pear chocolate sauce vanilla ice cream crystallized violet perfumer keep pear vivid juicy pear add green rosy musky note apricot top heart underline zest tangerine powdery woodiness violet another facet osmanthus boost pure orris butter balance classic partner rise ylang ylang add contrast rich floral fleshiness leather osmanthus drawn heart anchor base burn sweet woody licorice accord drop citrus rise vetiver patchouli oak moss base la belle hala ne also essentially chypre third mdcis lineup decidedly nonclassic chypre silky musky juicy lighthearte fact like namesakethe beautiful helen quite charmer like escoffier culinary classic almost impossible not bite

The opening is bright and invigorating, a delightful amouse-bouche of zesty lime and citron spiked with a delicious dose of coriander before the main course of rich, robust vanilla.

de bachmakov eau de parfum,The Different Company," In a tribute to his Russian ancestry and to celebrate the year of Russia in France, the Different Company's co-founder (with Jean-Claude Ellena) and renowned designer Thierry de Baschmakoff joined forces with the perfumer CÃ©line Ellena to compose the fragrance which bears his name. De Bachmakov is not a literal evocation of Russia, but a poetic fugue on the magical moment when snow begins to melt on the steppes and the earth gives way to the rites of spring; on the first rays of sun to touch the Siberian forests swept by winds from Asia. The fragrance is as limpid and bracing as a shot of ice-cold vodka: along with peppery, aromatic bergamot, the lemony, anise-tinged shiso leaves and tangy, zesty cilantro lend their green, aldehydic fizziness to the blend, sweetened by a sprinkle of nutmeg. Freesia and its tender, white floral notes add a jasmine richness to the heart: as the fragrance evolves, its limpidity gives way to a surprising chalk accord produced by a blend of woody notes and musk. De Bachmakov is sap and snow and the first spring flowers: a cool herbal potion brewed near the Arctic Circle. It is also the very gifted CÃ©line Ellena's last composition for The Different Company: all the more reason to snap up this gorgeous and truly unique fragrance."," Cedar wood, bergamot, shiso leaves, nutmeg, coriander leaves, white freesia, soft chalk accord",tribute russian ancestry celebrate year russia france different companys cofounder jeanclaude ellena renowned designer thierry de baschmakoff join force perfumer caline ellena compose fragrance bear name de bachmakov not literal evocation russia poetic fugue magical moment snow begin melt steppes earth give way rite spring first ray sun touch siberian forest sweep wind asia fragrance limpid brace shoot icecold vodka along peppery aromatic bergamot lemony anisetinge shiso leave tangy zesty cilantro lend green aldehydic fizziness blend sweeten sprinkle nutmeg freesia tender white floral note add jasmine richness heart fragrance evolve limpidity give way surprising chalk accord produce blend woody note musk de bachmakov sap snow first spring flower cool herbal potion brew near arctic circle also gift caline ellenas last composition different company reason snap gorgeous truly unique fragrance
memoir man eau de parfum,Amouage," The releases from the house of Amouage over the past three years have had a uniting thread: uncomporomised richness and beauty.  Their new series Memoir presents a new chapter in this narrative as conceived by Creative Director, Christopher Chong. Turning the industry norm of a dominant woman's fragrance on its head, Chong instead conceived the two Memoir fragrances from an inherently male point of view. Together, the Memoir fragrances offer a new interpretation of the space' between man and woman, one that is almost impossible to resist.Memoir Man is a FougÃ¨re, one that fractures the standard mix of Lavender and Oakmoss into bright shards by the addition of Basil and Mint and the further aspect of Absinth.  Like a tray of unset gems the topnotes sparkle on the skin, leading into heart notes of Woods and a rich, smooth base of Vanilla, Amber and the traditional Oakmoss.

une rose vermeille eau de parfum,Tauer Perfumes," A divinely saucy rose scent that flounces and shimmies and flirts its way into your heart and never lets you go. The opening is bright and juicy citrus with a hint of lavender  and then the vermillion rose unfurls its luscious petals. As you would expect from Andy Tauer, the rose is exceptionally vivid and true  deep and velvety and spicy, with a peppery bite that acts as the perfect foil to a delicious, intensely concentrated essence of raspberry. This is a raspberry that you would pick in a dream  the most perfect berry of the summer - so bright and pure and sweet that you would cry if you woke up before tasting another. The sparkling rose and raspberry jam is folded into a creamy base of vanilla, tonka bean and smooth sandalwood, taking us right to the brink of gourmand, but not quite crossing over. There is definitely an edible quality to Une Rose Vermeille  it conjures up marzipan and meringue and Bavarian cream  but it isn't pure dessert due to the startling freshness of the rose and the deep purr of the sandalwood. This rose is not just charming and delectable and adorably feminine, but a bit naughty, as well. Stunning."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, rose, raspberry, violet, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",divinely saucy rise scent flounce shimmy flirt way heart never lets go opening bright juicy citrus hint lavender vermillion rise unfurls luscious petal would expect andy tauer rise exceptionally vivid true deep velvety spicy peppery bite act perfect foil delicious intensely concentrated essence raspberry raspberry would pick dream perfect berry summer bright pure sweet would cry wake taste another sparkle rise raspberry jam fold creamy base vanilla tonka bean smooth sandalwood take us right brink gourmand not quite crossing definitely edible quality une rise vermeille conjure marzipan meringue bavarian cream not pure dessert due startling freshness rise deep purr sandalwood rise not charming delectable adorably feminine bit naughty well stunning
cuir - les nombres d'or eau de parfum,Mona di Orio," Rarely do leather scents come across our path that put us in a state of delightful shock. Opening with a whiff of Gauloise-like smoke it quickly becomes toasted spices and sweet absinthe before the appearance of the leather. Neatly straddling the line between biker and Birkin bag, the leather is almost carnal in its depth. In these days of anodyne scents and trans-fat free lives this is a welcome walk on the wild side that on a man would be wonderful. On a woman?

les nuits d'izu eau de parfum,Keiko Mecheri," Inspired by indigo nights on the Izu peninsula, the Riviera of Japan, this takes the classic cologne structure and gives it an Asian twist. It opens with a piquant, shimmering yuzu note  similar to that of grapefruit with overtones of Mandarin orange. The vibrant yuzu leads us like a colorful butterfly to an ethereal garden of rose japonica and dreamy jasmine. A base of ocean moss and hinoki, the Japanese cypress used for building shrines, palaces and the finest soaking baths, adds intrigue and depth. A fresh blend of tart citrus, delicate flowers and precious wood that delights the senses.

uden eau de parfum,Xerjoff," Xerjoff classifies Uden as a marine fougere, meaning that it smells of lavender, oak moss, and the sea. To us, although accurate in some ways, it simplifies Uden's unique complexity. If Uden is a marine scent, then its waters surround the Bahamas, where ancient traders traveled weeks across the treacherous Atlantic to barter for coffee and rum, both of which give Uden a delicious warmth. The rum and coffee are then packed in rough wood crates, which pick up the salty scent of the ocean as the boat's wooden timbers rock on the waves for further journey in the New World. Uden's ocean is the world of the seamen who risked their lives traversing the seas to bring the pleasure of the exotic to long ago drawing rooms.Uden opens with lavender and citrus, the harbingers of a traditional fougere. However, instead of traveling the clean, smooth path for which it seems destined, coffee and rum absolutes add their familiar, delicious notes. Combined with Uden's opening, the coffee and rum create an unfamiliar--yet completely tantalizing--heart to the fragrance. Uden dries down into a warm medley of wood infused with clean musk, providing a counterpoint to its sweet rum, rich coffee, and crisp citrus-lavender. Uden reminds us that wild worlds may belie the simplest pleasures."," Grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, Gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk",xerjoff classifie uden marine fougere meaning smell lavender oak moss sea us although accurate ways simplifie uden unique complexity uden marine scent water surround bahamas ancient trader travel week across treacherous atlantic barter coffee rum give uden delicious warmth rum coffee pack rough wood crate pick salty scent ocean boat wooden timber rock wave journey new world uden ocean world seamen risk life traverse sea bring pleasure exotic long ago draw room uden open lavender citrus harbinger traditional fougere however instead travel clean smooth path seem destine coffee rum absolute add familiar delicious note combine uden opening coffee rum create unfamiliaryet completely tantalizingheart fragrance uden dry warm medley wood infuse clean musk provide counterpoint sweet rum rich coffee crisp citruslavender uden remind us wild world may belie simplest pleasure
kobe eau de parfum,Xerjoff," In Kobe, Xerjoff created something unusual, yet somehow inevitable: a dry citrus, warm woody fragrance for men. Kobe smells like a finely crafted wooden box full of vividly scented citrus rinds. The wood of the box is of the best quality and from a mix of exotic trees, and the citrus peels inside are remarkably potent, but play more as spice than fruit. This marriage of tart and spicy with sweet and warm is what makes Kobe such a singular fragrance.Kobe opens with a bracing grapefruit rind note rounded out with petitgrain (an oil extracted from the green twigs of the bitter orange) and bright neroli. It feels fresh and alive, like opening a window on a crisp morning to an orange grove in early spring just as tight blossoms begin to push from the orange trees. After a few minutes, green wood begins to join the sharp citrus. The wood seems to age and sweeten over time to become more resinous and balsamic, transforming Kobe into an extraordinary, deep woody scent. It isn't just any wood, though. A vein of oud, an unusual, intimate aroma, runs through the fragrance of shaved rose wood. Fresh and warm, sweet and tart, Kobe is a fragrance for any time and anywhere."," Calabrese bergamot, Florida orange, Southern Italian neroli, Paraguayan petitgrain, rose wood, resins, oud wood, palisander, tonka, amber",kobe xerjoff create something unusual yet somehow inevitable dry citrus warm woody fragrance man kobe smell like finely craft wooden box full vividly scent citrus rind wood box good quality mix exotic tree citrus peel inside remarkably potent play spice fruit marriage tart spicy sweet warm make kobe singular fragrance kobe open brace grapefruit rind note round petitgrain oil extract green twig bitter orange bright neroli feel fresh alive like opening window crisp morning orange grove early spring tight blossom begin push orange tree minute green wood begin join sharp citrus wood seem age sweeten time become resinous balsamic transform kobe extraordinary deep woody scent not wood though vein oud unusual intimate aroma run fragrance shave rise wood fresh warm sweet tart kobe fragrance time anywhere

Orange Star is one of those remarkable ones, a special fragrance bursting with twinkling citruses like clementine, red mandarine, lemongrass, and brought halfway down to earth with the barely reined-in lusty notes of ambergris, vanilla, patchouli and the resinous ambreine.

gardenia petale eau de parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels," Unabashedly lush and feminine, GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale is perhaps the truest recreation of the gardenia's sensuality we've encountered. If you've ever dipped your nose into a gardenia's creamy petals, you know the narcotic opulence this flower possesses. In GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale, perfumer Nathalie Feisthauer captures all the stages of gardenia's life, from its almost citrusy, green bud to the delicate freshness of a newly opened blossom to the fulsome headiness of the gardenia in full bloom.GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale is an especially rich fragrance with grand sillage. We imagine wearing it on a summer's night when moonlight silvers the garden, or when the streets are carpeted in thick, white snow, setting off the fragrance's pure luxuriance. A dab of GardÃ©nia PÃ©tale behind the ears would perfectly complement the view of Paris from the Eiffel Tower, or dinner for two in a room bathed in candlelight.

fleur nocturne eau de parfum,Isabey," This Nocturnal Flower should've been called China Blue  or rather, Bleu de Chine  after the fragrance launched in 1925 by the house of Isabey, lodged in a China blue bottle designed by the legendary Julien Viard. But when Isabey's owners decided to re-launch the scent, the name Bleu de Chine had been snapped up by another brand. So Fleur Nocturne it is, for a fragrance as tight-grained and creamy-smooth as the most luxurious silk crepe, flowing on the sinuous silhouette of a 1930s film star, its delicate apricot hues lighting up petal-flesh skin. Like Isabey's previous scent Gardenia, Fleur Nocturne revives the opulence and full-blown glamour of classic French perfumery: an aromatic shimmer of mandarin melding into the fragrant juiciness of peach and apricot underlining the fruity facets of jasmine; the slightly soapy, lemony touch of magnolia balancing out the lazy Southern Belle lushness of gardenia. Solar notes add a powdery, tropical-flower tinge to the vanilla drydown, barely darkened by patchouli.With its ample, long-lasting sillage, Fleur Nocturne will sail you through nights as tender and glorious as a Scott Fitzgerald heroine in the Riviera moonlight."," Mandarin, apricot tree flower, white peach, jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, solar notes, vanilla, patchouli",nocturnal flower call china blue rather bleu de chine fragrance launch 1925 house isabey lodge china blue bottle design legendary julien viard isabey owner decide relaunch scent name bleu de chine snap another brand fleur nocturne fragrance tightgraine creamysmooth luxurious silk crepe flow sinuous silhouette 1930s film star delicate apricot hue lighting petalflesh skin like isabey previous scent gardenia fleur nocturne revive opulence fullblown glamour classic french perfumery aromatic shimmer mandarin melding fragrant juiciness peach apricot underlining fruity facet jasmine slightly soapy lemony touch magnolia balance lazy southern belle lushness gardenia solar note add powdery tropicalflower tinge vanilla drydown barely darken patchouli ample longlaste sillage fleur nocturne sail night tender glorious scott fitzgerald heroine riviera moonlight

al oudh eau de parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Oud may be the new black, as far as perfume notes are concerned. But Bertrand Duchaufour's take on the Ã¼ber-fashionable Middle-Eastern material lives up to the expectations raised by one of the most distinctive talents in the business.

From then on, a soft but unmistakably natural oud takes center stage, veering towards leather before sinking in the inkiness of castoreum; civet adds a whiff of the beast to the brew.As Al Oudh slides into its drydown, the comforting sensuousness of a balsamic vanilla and tonka bean base turns its desert lion growl into a purr.

patchouli intense eau de parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Patchouli is a material of great importance in the perfumer's palette. It plays as first violin in the orchestra. Among all the woody notes, it is the most sensuous. Patchouli evokes richness, writes Patricia de NicolaÃ¯. With Patchouli Homme, the perfumer wanted to compose a woody oriental for men, but she ended up selling it to women too (which is why it will soon be renamed Patchouli Intense). And why not? This distinctly un-hippie patchouli straddles both sides of the olfactory gender spectrum, with Patricia de NicolaÃ¯ signature candied orange opening, sprinkled with cinnamon, sweetening the wedding of a deep, dark, earthy patch and its natural partner, rose. A passing quote of the fougÃ¨re family  lavender and geranium  lightens the heart of this heady blend before it subsides into an incense-laden, almost tarry leather drydown that plays up the smokier facets of vanilla. A sophisticated patchouli for dandies (both male and female) who aren't afraid of snagging a sleeve on a rose bush when they go out in the garden to pick their boutonniÃ¨re."," lavender, Turkish rose, geranium Bourbon, frankincense, sandalwood, bay oil, cinnamon, patchouli, leather, amber, vanilla",patchouli material great importance perfumer palette play first violin orchestra among woody note sensuous patchouli evoke richness write patricia de nicolaa patchouli homme perfumer want compose woody oriental man end sell woman soon renamed patchouli intense not distinctly unhippie patchouli straddle side olfactory gender spectrum patricia de nicolaa signature candy orange opening sprinkle cinnamon sweeten wedding deep dark earthy patch natural partner rise pass quote fouga family lavender geranium lightens heart heady blend subside incenseladen almost tarry leather drydown play smoky facet vanilla sophisticated patchouli dandy male female not afraid snag sleeve rise bush go garden pick boutonnia
midnight oud eau de parfum,Juliette Has a Gun," Romano Ricci conceived his opus as a European vision of oud that evokes the mysterious and intriguing woman who hides behind her veil. Midnight Oud is a love song written for that ancient musical instrument called Oud in a palace where the walls are rose petals, the air breathes golden saffron and the floor is scented with sacred agarwood.The heavy oriental notes of traditional ouds are represented here in a very wearable and refined manner. Midnight Oud is crafted as a bridge between the perfect balance of rose-chypre-patchouli and the purest Oud perfume note. It is an imaginary black flower with glittery saffron and soft incense notes, and the heavy Moroccan rose petals become a precious liquor laced with tobacco, amber, agarwood and dried fruits. The resulting scent is rich, velvety and opulent, finding the right harmony between the dark strength of Arabian perfumes and the modern idea of richness."," Moroccan rose, geranium, saffron, oud note, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, animalic musks",romano ricci conceive opus european vision oud evoke mysterious intriguing woman hides behind veil midnight oud love song write ancient musical instrument call oud palace wall rise petal air breathes golden saffron floor scent sacred agarwood heavy oriental note traditional ouds represent wearable refined manner midnight oud craft bridge perfect balance rosechyprepatchouli pure oud perfume note imaginary black flower glittery saffron soft incense note heavy moroccan rise petal become precious liquor lace tobacco amber agarwood dry fruit result scent rich velvety opulent find right harmony dark strength arabian perfumes modern idea richness

epic woman eau de parfum,Amouage," Inspired by Puccini's Turandot, Amouage's Epic Woman is a masterful fusion of the smoldering opulence and sensuality of Arabia and the lyrical intensity of China.

feminite du bois eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," A milestone in the history of contemporary perfumery, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois can be considered as the template of Serge Lutens' trademark woods, fruit and spices variations. As the stories goes, Lutens, who had yet to launch his Salons du Palais Royal line, dragged the Shiseido and Quest teams to Marrakech to make them understand just what he was after: the quintessence of Atlas cedar. Christopher Sheldrake was the one who caught on; the great Pierre Bourdon completed the formula. The result was a breakthrough in the world of women's fragrances: a dark, honeyed, animalic wood rubbed with candied fruit, sweet balms and the slow burn of spices, encrusted with the amethyst flash of violets. Today, FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois, the mother of all Lutens fragrances, has left Shiseido and found its true home. It has shed its strangely compelling dusty pink and plum flacon and Lutens has officially admitted that the formula was slightly tweaked to comply with new regulations, though he maintains thatthe quality (creative and olfactive) remains authentic. Aficionados may find the top notes a tad softer and the base a little muskier, but the fragrance is still entirely, deliciously FÃ©minitÃ© du Bois. A masterpiece."," Ginger, cinnamon, clove, plum, peach, orange blossom, violet, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, benzoin",milestone history contemporary perfumery faminita du bois consider template serge lutens trademark wood fruit spice variation story go lutens yet launch salon du palais royal line drag shiseido quest team marrakech make understand quintessence atlas cedar christopher sheldrake one catch great pierre bourdon complete formula result breakthrough world womens fragrance dark honey animalic wood rub candy fruit sweet balms slow burn spice encrust amethyst flash violet today faminita du bois mother lutens fragrance left shiseido find true home shed strangely compelling dusty pink plum flacon lutens officially admit formula slightly tweak comply new regulation though maintains thatthe quality creative olfactive remain authentic aficionados may find top note tad soft base little muskier fragrance still entirely deliciously faminita du bois masterpiece

reflection man eau de parfum,Amouage," The quintessence of masculine elegance, Reflection Man captures the seductive power of a man's inner strength. Edgy and classic, the composition juxtaposes coldness of citrus with the warmth of spices. Top notes of rosemary, red pepper and bitter orange leaves are chilly and bracing, a jolting breath of icy air in the midst of summer. The piquancy, which is apparent from the start, is rich and fiery, but never sharp, smoothed and softened by the presence of velvety orris and creamy ylang-ylang. Floral notes contribute to the sun-drenched, summery feel of the blend without compromising its undeniably masculine feel. The base of vetiver, patchouli and sandalwood, combined with the spices and orris, is dark, enveloping, and sensual. Virile and unexpectedly soft at the same time...a luxurious modern classic."," Rosemary, red pepper berries, bitter orange leaves, neroli, orris, jasmine, ylang ylang, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood.",quintessence masculine elegance reflection man capture seductive power mans inner strength edgy classic composition juxtapose coldness citrus warmth spice top note rosemary red pepper bitter orange leave chilly brace jolt breath icy air midst summer piquancy apparent start rich fiery never sharp smooth soften presence velvety orris creamy ylangylang floral note contribute sundrenched summery feel blend without compromise undeniably masculine feel base vetiver patchouli sandalwood combine spice orris dark envelop sensual virile unexpectedly soft timea luxurious modern classic
complex eau de parfum,Boadicea the Victorious," The mood is Gothic; the scene, a dungeon; the scent, an unsettling dip into olfactory taboos. This is leather at its darkest, spiked with metallic studs of violet, lashed with the aromatic essences of basil and sage. Musk straddles the boundary between the herbal and animal realms, before submitting to the whip of leather  tarry, bitter, almost licorice-like in its somber facets.

tom of finland eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," Created for the eponymous artist's Foundation, Tom of Finland, is an ode to masculine beauty. It is that rare marvel, a clean leather scent.

The fragrance enhances the perfume of one's freshly-showered skin, revealing the true sensual power of a wearer's own aroma.

putain des palaces eau de parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," We are likely to fall for any perfume that makes us quietly hum Serge Gainsbourg's song in our rather imperfect French (and there aren't nearly enough of those!). And, when the perfume is as stunning as Putain des Palaces-- well, what can we say? We are madly in love! This sensuous fantasy of a scent is dressed for seduction: the powdery, rose-violet aroma of a lipstick, a hint of supple leather, a touch of spice, a subtle, insinuating animal quality of musk...the sensuality of silk and lace...the perfume of a temptress in a boudoir, coquettish, languid and a little dangerous.

vepres siciliennes eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," With VÃªpres Siciliennes, a verdant fruity chypre, Perfumer Jeanne-Marie Faugier embarks upon a different olfactory journey a journey to bella Italia. As the heat of the afternoon gives way to the early evening, it is a magical hour: Night is falling soon. The intoxicating smell of the orange orchards, still warm from the sun, rise up to meet the mysteries at hand for the evening, as lovers wait for the languor of evening shadows, and assassins heed the gathering darkness. Inspired by Verdi's opera of the same name, this fragrance honors the duality of man's nature the peaceful time of prayer and the uncertain dangers that await.The fragrance begins as a haunting, rich, lovely ode to an Italian tapestry of scent as we stroll through the orchard, with its smell of peppery citrus and crushed green leaves.  Unexpectedly we encounter scents drifting from a distant garden on the quiet breeze... the warm, sensual flowers of jasmine, magnolia, ylang ylang and heliotrope mingling with the earthy woods of cedar and oakmoss. The fragrance, like the day, then takes an unexpected twist-- instead of a drydown of woods, only then is the secret, surprising heart of the fragrance revealed: Fruits and flowers when we least expect it.  An early evening banquet is set out: Osmanthus, raspberry, clove, plum and peach entice us to linger, even as the shadows grow long beside us and the day grows still. It is the time for Vespers, and all is not what it seems.  An unexpectedly rich scent that evolves continually and delightfully for hours."," mandarin, grapefruit, peach, pepper, green leaves, cardamom, muguet, magnolia, jasmine, ylang ylang, rose, tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus, raspberry, cloves, plum, coconut, musk, amber, oakmoss, cedarwood",vaapre sicilienne verdant fruity chypre perfumer jeannemarie faugier embarks upon different olfactory journey journey bella italia heat afternoon give way early evening magical hour night fall soon intoxicate smell orange orchard still warm sun rise meet mysteries hand evening lover wait languor evening shadow assassin heed gather darkness inspire verdis opera name fragrance honor duality mans nature peaceful time prayer uncertain danger await fragrance begin haunting rich lovely ode italian tapestry scent stroll orchard smell peppery citrus crush green leave unexpectedly encounter scent drifting distant garden quiet breeze warm sensual flower jasmine magnolia ylang ylang heliotrope mingle earthy wood cedar oakmoss fragrance like day take unexpected twist instead drydown wood secret surprising heart fragrance reveal fruit flower least expect early evening banquet set osmanthus raspberry clove plum peach entice us linger even shadow grow long beside us day grow still time vesper not seem unexpectedly rich scent evolve continually delightfully hour
sublime balkiss eau de parfum,The Different Company," Balkiss was the name of the Queen of Sheba, the lover of King Solomon. But don't expect a spice-laden oriental. And though CÃ©line Ellena, who co-founded The Different Company along with her father Jean-Claude and legendary bottle designer Thierry de Baschmakoff, touts Sublime Balkiss as a chypre, don't expect a classic chypre either.The canonic bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss trilogy has been set aside and the scent retains only the structure of the chypre: mouthwatering bergamot, astringent cassis and blackberries stage the juicy, slightly raspy opening burst; damascene rose, lily of the valley and lilac provide the soft floral heart, with a lashing of green violet leaves and heather; two different types of patchouli grounding the composition. One is the traditional essence of patchouli; the other, more unusual one, is a fraction of patchouli essential oil, which brings out the cocoa facets of the heart notes (a chocolate-like effect similar in Serge Lutens' BornÃ©o 1834).With its berry top notes and patchouli base, Sublime Balkiss is sure to appeal to Angel fans  if you've given up on Thierry Mugler's classic because it was too popular, or too potent, you'll find the familar accord played in the lighter hand of the trademark Ellena style."," Bergamot, cassis, blackberries, rose, lily of the valley, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli fraction, patchouli essence, heather.",balkiss name queen sheba lover king solomon not expect spiceladen oriental though caline ellena cofounded different company along father jeanclaude legendary bottle designer thierry de baschmakoff tout sublime balkiss chypre not expect classic chypre either canonic bergamotlabdanumoakmoss trilogy set aside scent retain structure chypre mouthwatere bergamot astringent cassis blackberry stage juicy slightly raspy opening burst damascene rise lily valley lilac provide soft floral heart lash green violet leave heather two different type patchouli ground composition one traditional essence patchouli unusual one fraction patchouli essential oil bring cocoa facet heart note chocolatelike effect similar serge lutens bornao 1834 berry top note patchouli base sublime balkiss sure appeal angel fan give thierry mugler classic popular potent find familar accord play light hand trademark ellena style
nuit de cellophane eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Cellophane night? The name was meant to shock, says the enigmatic maestro of the Palais Royal -- though what it alludes to is simply the material used to wrap bouquets in flower shops.At first sniff, you may think Serge Lutens has gone mainstream. Nuit de Cellophane is, undeniably, a fruity floral drowned in a cloud of fluffy musk. But smell more closely, and the little night music running through the Lutens opus will make itself heard: the stained-glass light of mandarin, warmed by the solar cinnamon roundness of myrrh, drowns the dusk-blooming, indolic jasmine in sunset hues. A slight mentholated whiff betrays a roving tuberose throwing her green flash.Chinese osmanthus, with its juicy apricot sweetness and suede-like facets, is offset by the clove-y warmth of carnation and the milky lushness of almonds. A touch of lily adds smokiness to the blend, melding into the woody, creamy sandalwood base drowned in honey. A deceptively innocent, multi-textured fragrance whose carnal whispers will draw you into the luminescent sparkle of a cellophane night..."," Green note, fruity note, jasmine, osmanthus, carnation, lily, muscs, almond, wood, honey",cellophane night name mean shock say enigmatic maestro palais royal though allude simply material use wrap bouquet flower shop first sniff may think serge lutens go mainstream nuit de cellophane undeniably fruity floral drown cloud fluffy musk smell closely little night music run lutens opus make hear stainedglass light mandarin warm solar cinnamon roundness myrrh drowns duskblooming indolic jasmine sunset hue slight mentholate whiff betray rove tuberose throw green flash chinese osmanthus juicy apricot sweetness suedelike facet offset clovey warmth carnation milky lushness almond touch lily add smokiness blend melding woody creamy sandalwood base drown honey deceptively innocent multitexture fragrance whose carnal whisper draw luminescent sparkle cellophane night

gold woman eau de parfum,Amouage," Every woman needs a Grand Perfume in her arsenal, a fragrance that will make her feel like Jean Harlow in a satin gown descending a marble staircase. Gold Woman is just that fragrance. Legendary perfumer Guy Robert created Gold using the highest quality ingredients that money could buy. He artfully melded more than 120 essences into an opulent perfume he calls the ""crowning glory"" of his career. Gold opens with a champagne-like burst of greens and lily of the valley, giving way to a floral symphony rich with rose and jasmine but so lushly orchestrated that it's difficult to isolate any one note.

Black pepper adds zing to cedrat's zest, enhancing its freshness and enriching the blend. The dry woods and patchouli create depth and make the cologne exceptionally long-lasting.

un bois vanille eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Picture yourself far away from the city, surrounded by tall, hundred-year-old trees, the hush of the forest broken by the crackling of a small fire. In the air there is a nostalgic blend of burning wood and molten sugar. Yes, we are picturing a marshmallow bubbling and turning dark golden on the end of a stick, and it's making us extremely happy, but this scent is much darker and richer than that simple image from childhood first implies. The wood is deep and pungent and singed at the edges, and the vanilla is rich and enveloping, its sweetness tempered with bitter almond. There is the tantalizing aspect of something caramelizing  not caramel candy, this is not  a candy sort of scent  -  but the far more mysterious fragrance of sweetness morphing and evolving as it is licked by flame; the indescribable lusciousness of something almost, but not quite, burning.

datura noir eau de parfum,Serge Lutens," Seductive and mesmerizing, this takes the familiar theme of white flowers, coconut and vanilla and puts a dark and mysterious spin on it.

A wickedly insistent blend of datura, osmanthus, heliotrope and tuberose beckons us to go ever deeper into the dark heart of the jungle. Voluptuous tonka and vanilla lull us into a dreamy haze, while unexpected touches of bitter almond and myrrh keep us wary and on the lookout for danger. Datura Noir does not reveal itself as a straightforward journey, but as a series of flickering impressions: one moment purely floral, the next apricot sweet, and the next richly gourmand.  Somehow they all fit together beautifully, like the elements of like a particularly wild and vivid dream.

rock crystal eau de parfum,Olivier Durbano," Cristal de Roche (Rock Crystal) is the first of Durbano'sperfume poems,  an enigmatic scent inspired by the myth surrounding rock crystal and the magical,  mystical aura of frankincense.  Centuries ago,  rock crystal was thought to be ice that could not be melted; this mineral represents the link between man and nature,  the notion of man's place within the universe and the union of man with a higher force.  Frankincense,  a resinous substance venerated for centuries in places of worship,  is thought to carry prayers uttered by mortals towards the heavens. Durbano brings this to the forefront of Cristal de Roche,  as incense and resins of frankincense,  olibanum,  benzoin and myrrh rise like columns of deeply fragrant smoke to symbolise the joining of heaven and earth.

The citruses have a candied quality, which teasingly hints at the delicious sweetness, but never steps into the realm of the gourmand.

ambre topkapi eau de parfum,Parfums MDCI," Created by the renowned perfumer Pierre Bourdon, the first MDCI fragrance for men, Ambre Topkapi was meant to embody strength, power and wealth, and was inspired by the striking figure crowning the men's flacon. The scent, with its bracing and strapping notes, is forceful and daring. We admire the way the tradition and modernity meet and intertwine in this handsome, truly regal composition. The top notes are the perfumer's nod to the classic masculine scents: the beginning of Ambre Topkapi is brightened by bergamot, spiced up by ginger and have a cool, herbal undertone of basil, thyme and lavender. The heart notes, with their combination of luxurious leather and soft, sweet sandalwood, add depth, warmth and what we can only described as a veryexpensive feel to the blend.

tubereuse couture eau de parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Created in the spirit of High Fashion, Tubereuse Couture is an exotic and elegant fragrance, which contrasts the creamy beauty of tuberose with the mouthwatering, green sweetness of kalamanzi and sugar cane. The striking juxtaposition starts in the top notes, where the tangy fruitiness of citrus is combined with the languorous floral notes of tuberose and ylang-ylang. Ylang-ylang is apparent at all stages of the scent's development and serves to emphasize and strengthen the velvety, enveloping quality of the tuberose. The sugar cane, on the other hand, adds a fresh aspect to the composition, keeping it from becoming overwhelmingly heady and buttery-sweet, as so many tuberose scents are prone to do. The base notes of Tubereuse Couture are resinous, a little powdery,  and like the rest of this fashionable blend, very refined."," kalamanzi oil, green jasmine shoots, ylang-ylang, sugar cane, Indian tuberose, Sumatra benzoin, papyrus.",create spirit high fashion tubereuse couture exotic elegant fragrance contrast creamy beauty tuberose mouthwatere green sweetness kalamanzi sugar cane strike juxtaposition start top note tangy fruitiness citrus combine languorous floral note tuberose ylangylang ylangylang apparent stage scent development serve emphasize strengthen velvety envelop quality tuberose sugar cane hand add fresh aspect composition keep become overwhelmingly heady butterysweet many tuberose scent prone base note tubereuse couture resinous little powdery like rest fashionable blend refined

amaze parfum eau de parfum,People of the Labyrinths," To say this fragrance has been highly anticipated would be an understatement. The first fragrance from People of the Labyrinths, Luctor et Emergo, has a rabid cult following that includes all of us here at Luckyscent and we've spent hours discussing what this line's new scent would be like incredibly complex,cutting edge,something no one expects! And that last one would be correct, because none of us expected a simple, elegant rose scent.  Saffron and henna warm up the opening and there are soft woods and musk in the mix, but mostly there is rose. Not a bouquet of roses or a rose garden, but a single, perfect, magical rose that we can envision clearly --- it's the enchanted rose inBeauty and the Beast floating in its glass dome, wondrous and eternal and glowing. Initially the rose is a bit forceful, but as you wear A*MAZE  it melts into your skin and becomes warm and powdery and subtle, as if you just emerged from a rose petal bath. This is a must-try for rose lovers, and you know who you are, but it will also have a lot of appeal for those who enjoy soft, clean fragrances because the drydown is essentially a rosy skin scent. It has even earned the love of one staffer who has sworn repeatedly that she would never wear a rose fragrance. We told you it was enchanting."," Henna, Saffron, Taif Rose, Orange Blossom, Wardia Rose, Agarwood, Sandalwood, Musk, Civet.",say fragrance highly anticipate would understatement first fragrance people labyrinth luctor et emergo rabid cult follow include us luckyscent spend hour discuss line new scent would like incredibly complexcutte edgesomethe no one expect last one would correct none us expect simple elegant rise scent saffron henna warm opening soft wood musk mix mostly rise not bouquet rose rise garden single perfect magical rise envision clearly enchant rise inbeauty beast float glass dome wondrous eternal glow initially rise bit forceful wear amaze melt skin become warm powdery subtle emerge rise petal bath musttry rise lover know also lot appeal enjoy soft clean fragrance drydown essentially rosy skin scent even earn love one staffer swear repeatedly would never wear rise fragrance tell enchanting
ambre russe eau de parfum,Parfum d'Empire," The moment we smelled Ambre Russe, we knew that we found our new Holy Grail amber scent. It is a baroque, luxurious perfume; its very notes spell excess. The legendary wealth of the Tsars, the rivers of vodka and champagne, the tea and honey, the sinful leather, the incense burned as an atonement for one's sins  it's all here. As rich as it sounds, however, the fragrance is not heavy or overwhelming; the lavish notes are blended masterfully, smoothly, in a composition that is warm, sensual and comforting. After the initial hot blast of amber and incense, a velvety, honey-like accord becomes apparent, along with the feisty and exhilarating 'boozyness', which lightens the mood of this dark brew. The tea note, combined with spices and leather, adds very enjoyable smokiness and emphasizes the full-bodied, darkly-ornate character of Ambre Russe. This is an extravagant, captivating perfume, quite unlike any other scent we have ever experienced."," tea, incense, vodka, champagne, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ambergris, vanilla, leather",moment smell ambre russe know find new holy grail amber scent baroque luxurious perfume note spell excess legendary wealth tsar river vodka champagne tea honey sinful leather incense burn atonement one sin rich sound however fragrance not heavy overwhelming lavish note blend masterfully smoothly composition warm sensual comfort initial hot blast amber incense velvety honeylike accord become apparent along feisty exhilarate boozyness lightens mood dark brew tea note combine spice leather add enjoyable smokiness emphasizes fullbodie darklyornate character ambre russe extravagant captivate perfume quite unlike scent ever experienced

soavissima eau de parfum,Profumum," Elegant and gentle, this is the slipper-footed princess of powder scents tiptoeing about her boudoir, draped in gleaming satin with a flounce of lacy sweetness following her in a puff. Delicate, powdery white flowers with a rose-like air melt seamlessly into powdery amber and are enhanced with ... well, more powder. Yes, there is a lot of powder here and it's all blended with a deft hand that emphasizes its soft, refined femininity.

Ladylike and lovely."," powdery notes, white flowers, amber",elegant gentle slipperfoote princess powder scent tiptoe boudoir drape gleam satin flounce lacy sweetness follow puff delicate powdery white flower roselike air melt seamlessly powdery amber enhance well powder yes lot powder blend deft hand emphasizes soft refined femininity initial puffy cloud aspect settle dry warm nostalgic comfort scent life name translate assuper smooth ladylike lovely
confetto eau de parfum,Profumum," An absolutely gorgeous rendition of almond that teases us with glimpses of bitterness glittering darkly behind the expected sweetness, keeping us unsettled and intrigued and coming back for more. Not that sweetness isn't present in Confetto  it's there, but it's complicated. Without its frequent companions vanilla and rose, almond is less of a comfort food and more of a provocative elixir. A pronounced anise note coaxes out its sensuous side and a soft bed of amber and musk lead it even further away from candyland. For us, Confetto's mesmerizing blend of sugar and shadow created an instant craving and left us weak in the knees. Bewitching."," sugared almond, amber, musk, hint of anise",absolutely gorgeous rendition almond tease us glimpses bitterness glitter darkly behind expect sweetness keep us unsettle intrigue come back not sweetness not present confetto complicated without frequent companion vanilla rise almond less comfort food provocative elixir pronounce anise note coaxes sensuous side soft bed amber musk lead even away candyland us confettos mesmerize blend sugar shadow create instant craving left us weak knee bewitching
dulcis in fundo eau de parfum,Profumum," This opens with a very fresh, very sweet orange, like a clementine being peeled, complete with the tangy sharpness of citrus oil on your fingers. Then the sweetness intensifies and becomes richer, as if drizzled with Grand Marnier, and a billowy dollop of luscious, creamy, unadulterated vanilla tops it all off. Warm and brazenly sweet, this ambrosial blend is for the woman who wants to smell delicious. This is dessert at its irresistible best: whipped cream being licked off fingers, fits of giggles fueled by liqueur, suggestive whispers over shared spoonfuls. We suspect that more is going on here than citrus and vanilla (some say a saucy little apricot was involved) but perhaps it is just a citrus and a vanilla that get along exceedingly well. Delectable."," Citrus fruits, Mexican vanilla",open fresh sweet orange like clementine peel complete tangy sharpness citrus oil finger sweetness intensifie become rich drizzle grand marnier billowy dollop luscious creamy unadulterated vanilla top warm brazenly sweet ambrosial blend woman want smell delicious dessert irresistible good whip cream lick finger fit giggle fuel liqueur suggestive whisper share spoonful suspect go citrus vanilla say saucy little apricot involve perhaps citrus vanilla get along exceedingly well delectable
fumidus eau de parfum,Profumum," Fumidus means smoky, and smoky it is. The smokiness of aged Laphroaig scotch served neat, It is also earthy  the earthiness of rich, freshly tilled land surrounded by uncut forest. Deep and magnetic and commanding, this blend of rich peat, grassy vetiver and brisk birch conjures up a vast estate and its moody young lord making his way through the fog on an unruly stallion. It's outdoorsy, but in a way that makes it clear that you don't just work in the forest, you own that forest yourself, along with a good bit of grassland and quite possibly a castle. Unmistakably masculine and very sexy."," Essence of distilled scotch, vetiver root, birch bark",fumidus mean smoky smoky smokiness aged laphroaig scotch serve neat also earthy earthiness rich freshly till land surround uncut forest deep magnetic command blend rich peat grassy vetiver brisk birch conjure vast estate moody young lord make way fog unruly stallion outdoorsy way make clear not work forest forest along good bit grassland quite possibly castle unmistakably masculine sexy

Airy incense and resinous cistus intermingle with the deep, sweet earthiness of patchouli and vetiver, creating a fragrance that is both spiritual and grounded. Fans of Comme des Garcon's Incense series (particularly Kyoto and Avignon)  will want to try this, as well anyone who has been longing for an incense scent without gothic overtones. Warm and reassuring."," incense, cistus, grey amber, patchouli, vetiver",mesmerize incense blend come dangerously close put us actual trance conjure grand stonewall cathedral not dark dank gloomy place light majesty infinite calm envision dreamy tendril smoke rise sunlight streaming stain glass windows feel reassure warmth wood sunwarmed stone airy incense resinous cistus intermingle deep sweet earthiness patchouli vetiver create fragrance spiritual ground fan comme des garcon incense series particularly kyoto avignon want try well anyone longing incense scent without gothic overtone warm reassure
vanille absolu eau de parfum,Montale," Smooth and sweet, silky and enveloping, Vanille Absolu is everything you could ever desire in an upscale vanilla: swirly folds of boozy vanilla are set off and enhanced by soft woods and a touch of cinnamon and clove. It's more like the pure distilled essence of a true vanilla bean pod than the wafer cookie vanillas that have flooded the market in the last few years, but make no mistake: this beauty flaunts its sweet depths with wild abandon and really doesn't care who's looking. A refined vanilla without being snooty, we can think of several perfumes that trumpetvanilla in their name then try to bury the note under a pile of florals or other notes in an effort to beclassy.  Montale got it right  there's a reason so many of us love the smell of vanilla, and Vanille Absolu is it.

It's both professional and sexy, a wonderfully confusing mix of freshness and depth.  We're quite certain that the notes given to us by Montale are missing an ingredient or two, but if we had to guess, we'd say there's a mysterious citrus in here as a topnote, and we love it. Like the cut of a perfectly tailored shirt worn by a man with confidence who really couldn't care less about decking himself out in the newest, weirdest fashion, Wood & Spices is a very real, modern scent. This one will turn heads  but not because it's freaky, but because it's loaded with class and easy elegance."," ebony, sandalwood, vetiver; incense, cardamom, spices",new interpretation timeless men combination wood spice montale continue break new ground find gorgeous fragrant ways surprise us professional sexy wonderfully confusing mix freshness depth quite certain note give us montale miss ingredient two guess would say mysterious citrus topnote love like cut perfectly tailor shirt wear man confidence really could not care less deck new weird fashion wood spice real modern scent one turn head not freaky loaded class easy elegance

bronze eau de parfum,Nanadebary," Bronze is a naughty little vixen of a scent, slinking out of the bottle with a sultry spiced jasmine and the teasing tang of bergamot and mandarin orange.

At the base are the mood altering warm scents of amber, vanilla and musk, while mere wisps of cedar and patchouli provide the backdrop.

1270 eau de parfum,Frapin," Named for the year the Frapin family established itself in the Cognac region of France (and continues to make cognac to this day), 1270 was created by Beatrice Cointreau, great granddaughter of Pierre Frapin. Together with Frapin's Cellar Master, she sought to create a noble fragrance full of the scents surrounding the creation of cognac. 1270 is dry, rich, velvety and smooth. The flowers of the once-proud Folle Blanche (a grape nearly extinct from the region), the vineyard grass,  the wine warehouse, the rich smell of damp earth in the cellars, the wood of new casks, the loamy smell of humus where the ancestral cognacs are stored all these notes can be detected in 1270. Gorgeous is putting it  mildly... this scent defies flowery prose.  A true masterpiece."," exotic woods, spice, raisin, vine flowers, pepper, candied orange, nut, hazelnut, prune, cocoa, coffee, leather, woods, white honey, vanilla",name year frapin family establish cognac region france continue make cognac day 1270 create beatrice cointreau great granddaughter pierre frapin together frapins cellar master seek create noble fragrance full scent surround creation cognac 1270 dry rich velvety smooth flower onceproud folle blanche grape nearly extinct region vineyard grass wine warehouse rich smell damp earth cellar wood new casks loamy smell humus ancestral cognacs store note detect 1270 gorgeous put mildly scent defie flowery prose true masterpiece
