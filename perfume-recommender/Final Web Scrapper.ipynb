We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art. This fragrance,  we just want to wear for ourselves.\", 'Notes': 'Bergamot, red apple, cedar, cinnamon, musk, vanilla and coconut.', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Oud for Greatness Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Initio Parfums', 'Description': 'The concept of “sacred geometry, ” the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness,  is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large,  transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. A fragrance that was only meant to belong to 250 of the world\\'s wealthiest collectors is now available, and we could not be more thrilled to offer it.', 'Notes': 'Citrus, jasmine, saffron, sage, ambergris, oakmoss, cedar', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait', 'Brand': 'Tauer Perfumes', 'Description': \"If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L’Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.\", 'Notes': '', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': '10 Piece Womens Gift with Purchase by\\nLuckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Brand': 'Luckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Description': \"For every purchase of $100 or more, get this women's gift with purchase sample pack.

With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

In fact, all we can smell is a smooth, skin-like, we-can't-put-our-finger-on-it fragrance afterthought that might as well be our own skin…but it isn't. There is a slight mineral-like edge to it but it's transparent and mild…if you're the type of person who can instantly tell the taste of plain water versus a mineral water like Evian, you'll instantly pick up on the gentle nuances of  Molecule 02. To sum it up, Molecule 02 is very light yet always present and hovering about four inches above where you applied it, especially after a few hours.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla… perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Musc Invisible delivers an ample amount of the former and just the right amount of the latter, a delightfully clean, gently powdered cloud of floral musk with just the right amount of silky sexiness- a balance that Ricci describes as \"the smell of clean skin just starting to sweat.\" In other words, Musc Invisible is aptly named, a skin scent that lends such natural smoothness to the wearer that those around you might be forgiven for wondering if you just smell that good all the time.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?\\rAnd the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish.

This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.  The science of scent is truly on display and is sure to delight those woody fragrance aficionados who love to venture forth and discover something devastatingly unique. A true phenomenon in its own right. \\rPlease note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle.

The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. A fragrance that was only meant to belong to 250 of the world\\'s wealthiest collectors is now available, and we could not be more thrilled to offer it.', 'Notes': 'Citrus, jasmine, saffron, sage, ambergris, oakmoss, cedar', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait', 'Brand': 'Tauer Perfumes', 'Description': \"If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L’Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.\", 'Notes': '', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': '10 Piece Womens Gift with Purchase by\\nLuckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Brand': 'Luckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Description': \"For every purchase of $100 or more, get this women's gift with purchase sample pack.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla… perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

Musc Invisible delivers an ample amount of the former and just the right amount of the latter, a delightfully clean, gently powdered cloud of floral musk with just the right amount of silky sexiness- a balance that Ricci describes as \"the smell of clean skin just starting to sweat.\" In other words, Musc Invisible is aptly named, a skin scent that lends such natural smoothness to the wearer that those around you might be forgiven for wondering if you just smell that good all the time.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla… perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Musc Invisible delivers an ample amount of the former and just the right amount of the latter, a delightfully clean, gently powdered cloud of floral musk with just the right amount of silky sexiness- a balance that Ricci describes as \"the smell of clean skin just starting to sweat.\" In other words, Musc Invisible is aptly named, a skin scent that lends such natural smoothness to the wearer that those around you might be forgiven for wondering if you just smell that good all the time.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?\\rAnd the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish.

This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.  The science of scent is truly on display and is sure to delight those woody fragrance aficionados who love to venture forth and discover something devastatingly unique. A true phenomenon in its own right. \\rPlease note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle.

The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. A fragrance that was only meant to belong to 250 of the world\\'s wealthiest collectors is now available, and we could not be more thrilled to offer it.', 'Notes': 'Citrus, jasmine, saffron, sage, ambergris, oakmoss, cedar', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait', 'Brand': 'Tauer Perfumes', 'Description': \"If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L’Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.\", 'Notes': '', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': '10 Piece Womens Gift with Purchase by\\nLuckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Brand': 'Luckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Description': \"For every purchase of $100 or more, get this women's gift with purchase sample pack.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla… perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

Musc Invisible delivers an ample amount of the former and just the right amount of the latter, a delightfully clean, gently powdered cloud of floral musk with just the right amount of silky sexiness- a balance that Ricci describes as \"the smell of clean skin just starting to sweat.\" In other words, Musc Invisible is aptly named, a skin scent that lends such natural smoothness to the wearer that those around you might be forgiven for wondering if you just smell that good all the time.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla… perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Musc Invisible delivers an ample amount of the former and just the right amount of the latter, a delightfully clean, gently powdered cloud of floral musk with just the right amount of silky sexiness- a balance that Ricci describes as \"the smell of clean skin just starting to sweat.\" In other words, Musc Invisible is aptly named, a skin scent that lends such natural smoothness to the wearer that those around you might be forgiven for wondering if you just smell that good all the time.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

We have to admit,  we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging,  avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again,  don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious? La Danza Delle Libellule (“the dance of the dragonflies, ”),  a joyously self-assured fruity gourmand,  is the answer to our casual,  indulgent,  dare-we-say-girly? prayers. Based on an operetta by the Austrian composer Franz Lehar,  it's the kind bold,  beautiful,  and unapologetically feminine scent that's sure to conjure up fantasies of majestic castles and storybook romance to charm even the most jaded fragrance fan.\\rLike the delicately beautiful insects that inspired Lehar in the first place,  La Danza Della Libellule delights us with its playful grace. Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying. A pure vanilla,  supported with cocoa and musk,  comforts and pampers to soothe even the most troubled heart. We wear fragrance for plenty of reasons: for love,  for fashion,  for art.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?\\rAnd the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish.

This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself.

Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale.

Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.

It is one of the most mysteriously alluring scents wrapped in simplicity. For us, the phenomenon of Molecule 01 came completely out of left field. When we first encountered it in 2005, our first impression was that we couldn't smell a thing.  We weren't sure what to think, but we wore it just as the description urged us to do, and didn't really notice the subtle scent on ourselves. The response from others, however, was undeniable.  Each time we wore it, somebody would ask what we were wearing. It was astonishing how predictably this occurred. \\rMolecule 01 is an aroma chemical, which are used in virtually all modern fragrances to recreate scents like jasmine or cedar or a host of other familiar olfactory favorites. This fragrance, however, is the first to to pay homage to Iso E Super, which you probably know as a sweet sandalwood/cedar-like smell. Because Molecule 01 is an aroma chemical rather than a perfume, it behaves differently. You have to wear it to understand it. If you have a bottle Molecule and feel that it smells of nothing, be patient. Keep using it. The velvety woody note is highly sensitive to body chemistry and twists and turns as it evolves, combining with the wearers' own natural scent to create an extraordinary alluring quality.  The science of scent is truly on display and is sure to delight those woody fragrance aficionados who love to venture forth and discover something devastatingly unique. A true phenomenon in its own right. \\rPlease note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle.

The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don’t know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.', 'Notes': 'Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Serendipitous Eau de Parfum', 'Brand': 'Serendipity 3', 'Description': \"Scrumptious, luscious, irresistible - it's chocolate!

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief.

Naxos celebrates Sicily's deep and sensual heart with a rich, spicy, vital perfume, imbued with tradition but striving towards the contemporary. \\rNaxos opens with a joyous vitality, juicy citrus notes of bergamot and lemon blending smoothly with mellow lavender and jasmine, enhanced by a sharp and audacious contrast of precious spices. As a rich drydown of tobacco leaf, tonka and vanilla berries emerges, the classical, light and fruity top notes flow into something more passionate and exotic, evoking the fierce spirit of Sicilians past and present.

And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

Opening with an intensely juicy burst of apple and bergamot,  La Danza immediately distinguishes itself from more straightforward gourmands with its understated approach to sweetness: dry cedar and rich cinnamon give contrast to the bright fruitiness without ever getting sugary or cloying.

In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It’s a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike.

It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.

Only 250 of these bottles were produced, for a price of $4000 apiece. Now, for the first time ever, this spectacular fragrance is available to the world as Baccarat Rouge 540, a gorgeously woody floral-amber equal parts transparent, dense, and intense. \\rMFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The \"breeze\" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling \"heat\" accord. Finally, a \"mineral\" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. A fragrance that was only meant to belong to 250 of the world\\'s wealthiest collectors is now available, and we could not be more thrilled to offer it.', 'Notes': 'Citrus, jasmine, saffron, sage, ambergris, oakmoss, cedar', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait', 'Brand': 'Tauer Perfumes', 'Description': \"If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L’Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.\\rAu Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L’Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L’Air’s smoke. \\rThose who love L’Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.\", 'Notes': '', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': '10 Piece Womens Gift with Purchase by\\nLuckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Brand': 'Luckyscent Gifts With Purchase', 'Description': \"For every purchase of $100 or more, get this women's gift with purchase sample pack.

The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?\\rAnd the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion’s signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope—apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish.

It's the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance.

Natural ambroxan is one of the lusted after components of ambergris, the prohibitively costly, rare excretion of a sperm whale.

In fact, all we can smell is a smooth, skin-like, we-can't-put-our-finger-on-it fragrance afterthought that might as well be our own skin…but it isn't. There is a slight mineral-like edge to it but it's transparent and mild…if you're the type of person who can instantly tell the taste of plain water versus a mineral water like Evian, you'll instantly pick up on the gentle nuances of  Molecule 02. To sum it up, Molecule 02 is very light yet always present and hovering about four inches above where you applied it, especially after a few hours.

A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.\\rThis clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity.

A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.\", 'Notes': 'Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake', 'Image URL': 'https://static.luckyscent.com/images/interface/logo-flower.png'}, {'Name': 'The Big Book of Perfume Hardcover Book', 'Brand': 'NEZ', 'Description': 'The team from Nez, the olfactory magazine invites you on a very special journey to explore perfume in all its facets, delving into the heart of a fascinating yet little-known world.
