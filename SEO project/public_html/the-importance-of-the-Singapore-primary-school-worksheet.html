            <p class="text-faded mb-4">It is important for students not to lose confidence and desire to learn mathematics further. Therefore, students should be required to pay attention to the observation and thinking of particular problems (laws of connotation), analysis and exploration, induction and conjecture, summary and verification. Let students explore the law from a variety of angles, experience exploratory and creative mathematical activities in the process of fun. For example, in the Singapore primary school worksheet common type of questions:
              <br>Remainder concept
              <br>Equal Fractions Concept
              <br>Model Drawing Concept
