                     is the largest primary school mathematics workbook competition in Singapore with thousands of participants each year.
                    <br>
                    <h4>How to register?</h4>
                    <br>
                    Registration is usually through the Singapore primary school, but you can also register yourself. There are three divisions, <b>Singapore primary school workbook entry level, Singapore primary school workbook Senior level and Singapore primary school workbook intermediate level</b>.
                    <br>

                      <li>The age requirement for Singapore primary school workbook entry level is 9 years and under.</li>
                      <li>Singapore primary school workbook Senior level is under 12 years of age.</li>
                      <li>There is no age limit for the Open Group.</li>
                      <li>Specific age requirements will also be communicated for Singapore primary school workbook intermediate level</li>

                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Awards</h4>
                    
                    Gold prizes will be awarded for answering 3/5 questions or more correctly in Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 2 and Silver prizes for the following; Bronze prizes will be awarded for those who do not make it to Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 2 but Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 1 is closer to the score line. In addition, the top 30 individual prizes in each Singapore primary school workbook competition category will be awarded by the organizers. The details fluctuate slightly each year depending on the difficulty of the topic.
                    <br>
                    The SMO medals are an indicator of the Singapore primary school students in DSA and university applications, and are highly valued in Singapore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Competition Process</h4>
                    
                    
                    Each Singapore primary school workbook division is divided into Round 1 and Round 2, and Round 1 winners can enter Round 2. Round 1 is usually two hours and 30 minutes long with 25 questions, while Round 2 requires you to answer five questions in four hours.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 1, Singapore primary school workbook Senior level has 25 multiple-choice questions and Open has 25 fill-in-the-blank questions. Commonly tested topics include polynomials, inequalities, number sequences, extreme values, number theory, arranging and combining, probability theory, trigonometry, triangles, and circles.
                    
                    Generally, a correct answer to Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 1 and an open answer to Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 2 are recommended.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Content of the competition</h4>
                    
                    
                    In Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 2, Singapore primary school workbook Senior level and Singapore primary school workbook entry level's questions are very similar, but the difficulty level is different, so we will introduce Singapore primary school workbook entry level questions as a reference. 
                    <br>
                    
                    Geometry questions are usually about plane geometry, triangles and circles are still popular, and most of them can be solved simply by making auxiliary lines and basic properties of circles. Number theory questions are usually divisibility and congruence problems, which may require the use of properties such as Fermat's Small Theorem. Function problems usually use special points of functions (such as zero, symmetry points) and their basic properties such as factors.
                    
                  
                    Dyeing problems have become more popular in recent years and are more obvious but difficult to prove, requiring clever solutions. As each question takes a long time, it is recommended that you choose to try the more confident questions first, and then study other topics. Even if you don't know how to do it, you may want to write down your ideas, and there may be step-by-step instructions. 3 correct answers to Round 2 will win the Gold Prize, and 3 or less will win the Silver Prize, depending on the difficulty of the question.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Contest Time</h4>
                    
                    All Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 1 is at the beginning of the holiday season in June and Singapore primary school workbook competition Round 2 at the beginning of July, with little variation in exam times from year to year.
